### Heya Terasologist!

<br>

If you have visited our website in the past you might notice something different. Yep, we have a new design!

Our new website is heavily inspired by Google's Material Design and is inline with the Design Unification Project ([Read more](http://forum.terasology.org/threads/design-unification-project-web-game-etc.1746/))

<br>

### What's new?

<br>

##### Blog

 During Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2017, we realized that we need to create a platform to keep track of our progress and announce it to the public. Luckily, that idea came while I'm trying to update the website to use Jekyll as a better way to manage picture (Gallery). So, we now have blog posts that you can see at the front page of this site. Stay tune for our cool posts!

##### Better Gallery

 Now you can easily add new pictures to the gallery without writing a single line of HTML!

##### Responsive

 Our old website can be a bit hard to use in mobile devices. Worry no more! because our new website now adapts to your screen size to guarantee the best user experience as possible.

<br>

We are going to add more features soon, so stay tune for updates! If you find any issue with the new website, feel free to add it to our [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/movingblocks.github.com/issues)
