Yes, you read that correctly, we are mentoring TEN students\\nthis year! We want to take the opportunity to thank everyone involved in the project, mentors, students, and every\\ncontributor chiming in with ideas, tips, and tricks. You make this the awesome experience it truly is!\\n\\n# The Projects - An Overview\\nTo shed some light on the projects currently in progress I\'ll go through each and every one of them and briefly explain\\nits purpose. Some students have set up awesome blogs, interesting dev diaries, or are using our forum for communicating\\nprogress. If you want to learn more about a specific project, just follow the provided links.\\n\\n## Anatomy System and Genome Integration\\nArpan is working on improving the game play experience to bringing some more detail into the current health system.\\nInstead of a simple health bar, the project aims to add anatomical body parts (like head, arms, legs etc.) to creatures\\nand implement a Dwarf Fortress style health system which has effects on specific body parts (like a broken leg from\\nfalling down a cliff).\\n\\nThe second part of the project deals with integration of the Genome module for genetics effects with other modules like\\nSimpleFarming and WildAnimals for breeding and mutation effects. This opens up a whole new play-style of breeding and\\ncrossing animals and plants to retrieve varieties of specific characteristics.\\n\\nRead more about this project in [Arpan\'s Blog][].\\n\\n## External Server API\\nThe main goal of this project is to provide a HTTP/WebSocket server running inside the game server process that will\\nallow access to Terasology functionalities for players and server admins alike. For instance, actions like kicking or\\nteleporting players, changing game properties, adjusting game time, or loading a save game become available through\\nthose protocols - according to user permissions.\\n\\n![Sending chat messages from the web client to the running game instance](./client-console.png)\\n_Sending chat messages from the web client to the running game instance._\\n\\nUp to now, the server exposes some basic resources through HTTP and Websocket, and there is a web client that can\\nconnect to the server. Client side authentication is supported and allows to trigger in-game commands from the web\\ninterface. The blog entries contain all information you need in order to test it by yourself!\\n\\nRead more about this project in [Gianluca\'s Blog][].\\n\\n## Behavior Trees\\nThe concept of behavior trees has been around for some time now, the first implementation in Terasology dates back to\\n2013 when our contributor [synopia introduced them in the forum](http://forum.terasology.org/threads/behavior-trees.882/).\\nFor this Google Summer of Code project, Terasology’s behavior tree AI implementation is to be completed to the point\\nwhere it is easily usable by module authors and generally whomever wants to give their mobs behavior of any kind.\\n\\nWe are looking forward to a well documented behavior system living in the\\n[Behaviors module](https://github.com/Terasology/Behaviors/tree/behaviorv2), providing pre-defined behaviors, behavior\\nnodes, and easy hooks from a behavior node to check an actor’s status. Furthmore, communication with other Actors is\\ngoing to be simplified. The project also includes tutorials and example creatures using the system. You see, there will\\nbe nothing stopping you from bringing some clever mobs to the game!\\n\\nRead more on this topic in [David\'s Blog][].\\n\\n## Blender MD5 Exporter\\nKartikey chose to improving the current md5 exporter for blender to be better suited to the needs of Terasology. The\\nscript will automate most of the tasks for creating new blocks and models while providing an easy to use GUI for the\\nblender environment. Features like automating triangulation of faces, separating faces, exporting multiple animations,\\ncreating a prefab file for specific AI animations and GUI development will be implemented during this project. I\\nprobably have to point out that this project sticks out of the others in that it uses Python for implementation (we are\\nJava/JVM language dominated, otherwise).\\n\\nYou may want to check out [Kartikey\'s Project Board][] to stay up-to-date.\\n\\n## Destination Sol Overhaul\\nStarted back in 2015 as a demo, [Destination Sol][DestSol] is a Space Shooter that gives the player a chance to be the\\ncaptain of his own fantasy ship, fighting enemies and looting gold. After the initial hype settled down, the developers\\nwho originally made the game drifted off to other projects, and Destination Sol came to be managed by Moving Blocks.\\nHowever, the game has gone too long without updates, the associated tools that were once used to create assets for the\\ngame are no longer functioning, and a lot of features just leave the player discontent.\\n\\nThis project aims to change all that, and more. Aresh Mishra (vampcat) already applied a lot of work under the hood, for instance\\nsplitting up the game\'s core and engine, fixing the asset handling, and more. Have a look at [Vampcat\'s blog][] or [his project board][Vampcat\'s Project Board]\\nto learn more about the project status and what is yet to come.\\n\\n## Exploration World Gameplay\\nThe idea of this project is to bring together a ton of different independent features and develop a gameplay mode that\\nhas more depth. Currently Terasology has a lot of different features, but there is not really a good way for the user to\\nenjoy them. What is really missing is a consistent gameplay setting which offers some challenge to the end-user and\\nmakes the game enjoyable.\\n\\nWith this background Nihal is dragging _all the modules_ together - bringing wild animals to life (oh my deer!),\\nintegrating exploration logs into the journal, and building a bunch of traps and puzzles. There are videos and images\\nin the blog posts alongside great summaries of the work done. For a taste, here is a video showcasing the \\"Wipe Out\\nLava Room\\".\\n\\nYou should check out [Nihal\'s Blog][] for details, explanations, and background information.\\n\\n<div class=\\"video-container\\">\\n<iframe src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/djTG0Ovf_UI?ecver=2\\" width=\\"640\\" height=\\"360\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n## Telemetry System\\nTerasology has a CrashReporter that allows users to upload log files and report bugs in forum or Github issues. However,\\nthe error reporting process is kind of manual. It might limit the awareness of existing error. Besides, developers treat\\nthe error report in an inconvenient way: they need to read the log file line by line, collect the environment\\ninformation manually and guess what might be the cause of the error.\\nFurthermore, more _feedback_ from users is also needed: What are their systems? Does Terasology run smoothly in their\\nPCs? What is the users\' favorite module? Collecting this data can help Terasology make the decision of what kind of\\noptimization could be applied as well as help Terasology provide more fun for users.\\n\\n![](https://gabrielxia.github.io/img/telemetry/launch.png)\\n\\nTherefore, Gabriel is implementing automatic metric & error reporting.\\nExceptions and errors, i.e., abnormal behavior of the game, are tracked locally and may be send to a server to collect\\nthe reports. For metrics, [Snowplow][] tools are used to collect custom metric events. The data can be visualized on a dashboard for easy consumption. Note that no information is sent without the user\'s confirmation (opt-in).\\n\\nCheck out [Gabriel\'s Blog][] for more information.\\n\\n## Physics-based Combat System\\nCurrently, Terasology lacks a proper physics-based combat system. Basic combat, based entirely on proximity and angles,\\ncan currently be simulated. However, creating a combat system that could use high velocity projectiles and reacts with\\nenvironment much more dynamically (e.g., projectiles bouncing off surfaces) will be an important addition to the\\ngameplay.\\n\\nSwastik Garg(0shine0) aims at restoring much of the functionality of an old branch of the legacy combat system while also improving\\nAI with regard to new events and situations introduced by a functional combat system. The project also aims at defining\\nthe characters in anatomical way with different body parts and making them susceptible to disease.\\n\\nCheck out the [module\'s wiki][Combat Wiki] to learn more about the available features.\\n\\n## Sectors\\nThe focus of this project is to add sectors to the Terasology engine. Sectors are a level of entity storage between\\nchunk-scope and global-scope, which allows entities that would usually be put in the global scope to be split into\\nmultiple groups. Each of these groups can be run on a separate thread, or even on a separate server node.\\n\\nSector-level entities are still loaded when their chunks are unloaded, allowing simulations to continue when the player\\nis away, but they can be stopped if a whole sector is unloaded to increase performance. Vizaxo currently is in the\\nprocess of integrating this concept with [Dynamic Cities][] (developed during last year\'s GSOC) and potentially extend\\nit towards even more dynamic (moving) simulation subjects.\\n\\nGet more information on this project in [Vizaxo\'s Blog][] and the [forum update posts][sector updates].\\n\\n## Scenario Creation\\nTyler \'Cata\' took inspiration from the Minecraft community along with some pre-existing suggestions and ideas within\\nTerasology. The concept of Scenarios has been suggested in the past and is essential in order to properly develop any\\nnotion of _static_ worlds such as what would exist for [Light & Shadow][]. In addition, it provides assistance to\\ncreation of exploration worlds such parkour or puzzle maps.\\n\\nImplementing scenarios can be thought of as creating a _game maker_ utility set baked into Terasology.\\nThe following video shows the tool for defining regions in action.

I stumbled upon the Terasology project and hopped on to the org\'s IRC. It took me a while to get everything running from source. After I played around for a bit, I had a glance at the issue tracker. Conveniently, I found a couple of bite-sized bugs and I sent out PR fixes by the next morning. From there to a GCI mentor last winter and a GSoC student past summer, it has been a hell of a ride.\\n\\nMy name is Nihal \'nihal111\' Singh and this is my GSoC story.\\n\\n## Road to GSoC\\n\\nAfter having a few fixes, I played around and familiarized myself with the game. I moved on to solve a few bugs which were not so trivial. One of the bugs I solved even had a bounty attached but it turned out to be super easy and just required detective work. All this while the community was extremely supportive and encouraging, helping me on every step of the way.\\n\\nThe codebase was huge. Simply the Engine was so large that it could easily become intimidating for a newcomer. This, without taking into count the several dozens of modules that were under development. The number of modules is just so large that I still haven\'t seen them all. The community played an essential role here in making me comfortable and in solving all doubts I had.\\n\\nAfter a memorable GCI mentor experience, dealing with a huge pile of student tasks, I was excited to switch sides and become a GSoC student. I was confused on which item to apply for. There were several project ideas explicitly floated out by the organization that required work on. I finally decided to pick an item and sort of personalize it. The idea was open-ended directed at making an all-new Exploration World and in the process tying together the so many different isolated modules we had. I decided to go forward with creating an Adventure kind of gameplay mode with puzzles and such backed by a small self-written lore.\\n\\n## My Proposal\\n\\nWith the proposal period ending around early April, I had my proposal ready well before the deadline. This was crucial as I could get mentor feedback and tweak things here and there. The final proposal looked like [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3HM64I0M4DmYnVWUUpyQkZ2b1k/view). The proposal basically broke down whatever I planned to do into a reasonable and achievable weekly timeline. For most items, I was unsure about how time intensive they could get. The mentors recommended shifting a few items to a \\"Bonus\\" section. this turned out to be good advice, in hindsight.\\n\\n## Exploration World- Improved Gameplay\\n\\nThat was the title of my project. It mainly involved creating an adventure-centric gameplay mode where the focus is on exploration. I decided to do this by creating several puzzle settings with hidden items to find. In addition, I was interested in working on Wild Animals. There was an existing deer that simply moved around. I decided to make animal behavior more lifelike, facilitating the addition of more animals in future. All of this gameplay is wrapped around a lore that I\'ve written. Here is the gist of it-\\n\\n_The player ends up on a desolate planet devoid of other intelligent beings. He opens up his journal to find that this was meant to be just another exploration survey of one of the potential life-supporting planets in the neighboring galaxy. However, the wormhole that he created to get here has malfunctioned and closed, leaving him stranded with no communication whatsoever. The situation seems grim and his forlorn attempts to fire up the wormhole again fail terribly. Left with no option, he wanders around to have a look at the planet that might be the last he ever set foot on. Born a survivor, he\'s able to hunt for food and build basic tools to keep himself alive. Soon after he starts exploring, the player finds structures that clearly represent signs of the existence of intelligent life forms. He becomes careful. Fearing his own death by the hands of the natives, he builds a few tools to defend himself. Underneath one of the structures, he discovers a secret passage. Gathering courage he goes through it. He finds a puzzle that needs to be solved to reach a treasure which seems to be concealed from the unworthy. He finds a book in the treasure chests which reveals a few secrets but creates even more mysteries._\\n\\n_\\".. before the machines tear us apart, it\'s crucial to save the technology we\'ve created for the survivors to grow and fight back, to take back what\'s theirs. Most of our defenses have been destroyed, our houses burned and whatever we\'ve created is lost, but knowledge is something that doesn\'t die easily. If you\'ve survived and found this book, what follows are the blueprints of the revolutionary technologies that we’ve created. To build some of these, you might require some artifacts scattered around the entire world...\\"_\\n\\n_Soon he solves a few more and realizes that he can actually find a way back home by using the early civilization\'s technology to create what is known as a catapult portal that throws you across in space-time. He sets on a journey to find and solve all puzzles to find the necessary artifacts and manuscripts to build the portal so that he can travel back home._\\n\\nThe full lore can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GVmJEV2KKjqgxjtVR-_Lh7QsvRzQbfxg9qeHjimIbPg/edit#). Spoiler alert!\\n\\nThe GSoC results were out on the 4th of May. I remember, we had the countdown running on our IRC channel. At around 10 PM Indian Standard Time, I remember frantically refreshing the GSoC web page. It seemed to take forever to load. But when it finally did, I was delighted to find that my project had been selected. I also found out then about my mentors and other projects that had gotten selected.\\n\\n## Work Period\\n\\nSince my college starts around July end, my organization had agreed to accommodate my work period from May to July. Moreover, there was little need for the Community Bonding Period in my case, since I had been contributing for more than seven months.\\n\\n### Phase 1- Wild Animals and Behavior\\n\\nThis was the first phase of my project and lasted for nearly a period of three weeks. There was a [WildAnimals module](https://github.com/Terasology/WildAnimals) in existence since quite some time. However, it only had a deer that moved around idly. The deer had a set of animations for movement, looking around and idle. The pathfinding was buggy (soon after fixed by flo). When hit it would lose health and ultimately just disappear as a glitch when it’s health reached 0. My work dealt with adding different advanced behaviors for the different types of animals would contain. The procedure of adding an animal involves, creating the 3D animal model in blender, rigging it and adding animations to it. This model is then imported in game and attached with behaviors and attributes. Since this process of model and animation creation depends upon a designer and takes a while, all the new behaviors I worked on, were added to the existing deer.\\n\\nSwitch to an Event-driven Behavior System- To achieve the required behavior system which involved switching between different behavioral states for an animal, with great help from flo, I was able to build a new system. This allowed for effortless switches between simply reusable behavior trees without over-complicating a simple behavior tree for an animal. This is explained in great detail [here](http://nihal111.github.io/2017/05/08/GSoC-week1-2.html).\\n\\nEach behavior was stored as a package under the [AdvancedBehaviors module](https://github.com/nihal111/AdvancedBehaviors/). To add a specific behavior to an animal, it is as simple as adding a line referring to the specific Behavior Component to the animal\'s prefab (essentially a list of attributes). With the new system in place I was able to finally create the following behaviors:\\n\\n- **Flee on hit**- Hitting the animal, makes it flee away till it reaches a safe distance from the player. \\n- **Friendly**- The animal comes near the player when a player reaches in its vicinity.\\n- **Hostile**- The animal attacks the player if the player enters its vicinity.\\n- **Aggressive**- The animal attacks back when hit by the player.\\n- **Scared**- The animal runs away when the player approaches close, till it reaches a safe distance from the player.\\n\\nThe above-created behaviors can be added to several new animals. The scared behavior can be added to a chicken (which is almost ready at this point). The friendly behavior along with the flee-on-hit behavior can be attached to a dog. Here are a few videos on how the behaviors look like when applied to the deer-\\n\\n<div class=\\"row\\">\\n\\n<div class=\\"col-md-6\\">\\n\\n<div class=\\"video-container\\">\\n\\t<iframe width=\\"1024\\" height=\\"768\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/unAqMHKkSC0\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\"></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div class=\\"col-md-6\\">\\n\\n<div class=\\"video-container\\">\\n\\t<iframe width=\\"1024\\" height=\\"768\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SjuMzl-5qIc\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\"></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nNote: The flee behavior as shown in the videos was later modified such that the animal now runs away always in a direction away from the player/inflictor.\\n\\n### Phase 2- Preparing the Exploration World\\n\\nThis phase was spread over the remaining period of my GSoC project, nearly 2 months. The work in this phase was intermittent and often intertwined with work from Phase 3, dealing with creation of traps and puzzle elements around which the Exploration World was centered. Preparation of the Exploration World involved distributed work on several different modules. \\n\\n- [Journal](https://github.com/Terasology/Journal)- There was a Journal module in existence for long, but it was almost unused. The new gameplay mode relies upon and uses the Journal heavily. The existing Journal was heavily revamped to now include recipes along with pictures etc. The content of the Journal was decoupled from content modules to a separate module that could be easily added while creating a new gameplay mode. For instance, the [Wood and Stone Crafting Journal](https://github.com/Terasology/WoodAndStoneCraftingJournal) consists of all the journal entries relevant to the modules [WoodCrafting](https://github.com/Terasology/WoodCrafting) and [StoneCrafting](https://github.com/Terasology/StoneCrafting). This can be simply activated when needed in another gameplay setting.\\n\\n- [Lost](https://github.com/Terasology/Lost)- The new exploration world and gameplay template I extensively worked on over the summer is called Lost. This consists of all the assets specific to this gameplay mode and calls upon several children modules as dependencies. The World Generator \\"borrowed\\" from [NeoTTA](https://github.com/Terasology/NeoTTA) also lies here with some modification.\\n\\n- [Books](https://github.com/Terasology/Books)- Most of the lore and the clues for the puzzles resides in books, specifically created for Lost.\\n\\n- [Structure Templates](https://github.com/Terasology/StructureTemplates)- This module made by flo allows the creation of different structures in-game. This was used extensively to build the structures that enclose and hide the puzzle rooms. I\'ve made several structures like Pyramids, Stonehenge and Underground Temples to achieve this purpose.\\n\\n### Phase 3- Traps and Puzzles\\n\\nThis was arguably the most involved and fun part of my GSoC project. The exploration world revolved around the player finding hidden pieces of a portal that would take him back to his home planet. These pieces of the portal were hidden away, locked and protected by the puzzles. The puzzles consisted of several traps which served as obstacles to prevent the player from reaching the treasure. All of these elements were added under an [AdventureAssets](https://github.com/Terasology/AdventureAssets) module.\\n\\n#### Trap Items\\n\\n- **Swinging Blade**- A pendulum-like swinging blade of death. Come in contact with the sharp blade and it kills you. Sprint past a line of these swinging blades with timing and precision to get to the other side alive.\\n- **Wipe Out Surfboard**- A surfboard at the end of a rod, that revolves above a pool of lava. Miss the board, and you shall burn underneath.\\n- **Fireball Launcher**- A box that shoots out fireballs at different intervals and directions. Dodge past the incoming fireballs.\\n\\n#### Other Items\\n\\n- **Password Door**- The password door consists of a question that needs to be answered to unlock it. The answer can be given through an answer text field or a set of buttons. Give the wrong answer and you are instantly electrocuted to death.\\n- **Altar of Resurrection**- The altar of resurrection consists of an angel that lights up when interacted with. This serves as a checkpoint where you respawn after death.\\n\\n<div class=\\"row\\">\\n\\n<div class=\\"col-md-6\\">\\n\\n<div class=\\"video-container\\">\\n\\t<iframe width=\\"1024\\" height=\\"768\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MYmNFplY8Sc\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\"></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div class=\\"col-md-6\\">\\n\\n<div class=\\"video-container\\">\\n\\t<iframe width=\\"1024\\" height=\\"768\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mOG_v2AkBwo\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\"></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Short Statistical Summary\\n\\nThere have been a total of 72 PRs and quite a few independent commits in the new modules I’ve created. With over 19,000 lines of code, this summer has boosted my Github stats to a whole new level.\\n\\n![](http://nihal111.github.io/img/GSoCStreak.png)\\n\\nAll\'s not done. There are a few follow-ups. Some bonus items have been completed but several have barely been touched. The main timeline was followed almost as planned. There were several blockers in the way, some of which required extensive work on the Engine too.\\n\\n## What more to look at?\\n\\nThere have been a whole lot of videos I’ve made over the summer. You can have a look at them at [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVDrDJDt7sI8A9Ww1FekUMQ). I have also written a set of blog posts marking the progress I made through the summers. A list of all these can be found under the #GSoC tag [here](http://nihal111.github.io/tags/#GSoC).\\n\\nThe final product is the Lost game. Instructions to play are as follows:-\\n\\n1. Download [this release](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/releases/download/v1.5.0/TerasologyOmega.zip).\\n2. Extract the Omega.\\n3. Move the save folder called “Lost” inside TerasologyOmega/saves to the save directory-\\n    - in Windows, C:/Users/name/Saved Games/Terasology/\\n    - in Linux, /home/name/.local/share/terasology/saves/\\n    Alternatively, you can run the game with the -homedir flag.\\n    - in Windows, run the game from cmd using a command like: Terasology.x64.exe -homedir or add the -homedir flag to the target field of the shortcut to the exe file.\\n    - in Linux, modify the run_linux.sh script so that it has a -homedir flag at the end, like so: java -Xms128m -Xmx1536m -jar libs/Terasology.jar -homedir\\n4. Launch the game using the script or the .exe file.\\n5. Select Singleplayer -> Lost and load the saved game.\\n\\n## Future improvements\\n\\nAlthough I have checked off most of my primary targets from the proposal. There are quite a few things that need work on-\\n\\n1. Some of the traps like the Swinging Blade work well only in Single Player. This is because the Movement Prediction works quite differently on the server side. The `CharacterImpulseEvent` triggers differently even with a little lag.  \\n2. Traps like the Wipe Out, require the player to move constantly along with the surfboard. There have also been instances when a collision is not detected between the player and the surfboard. Again something to deal with the Movement Prediction and Physics engine.  \\n3. On the Gameplay side, I\'ve attempted to make interesting short riddles for the three treasure locations, however they get boring very fast. The player might feel it is too much effort to solve a text based riddle. It can be difficult to strike the right chord while making riddles and clues that are both short, engaging and require the player to think.  \\n4. The Portal upon construction does nothing yet. Well, it is supposed to take you back to your home planet. But I guess we could display a \\"Game Over\\" dialog or somehow bring up the Credits screen.  \\n5. The Phase 1 work of my project on deer has not been included in the final executable. The existing spawner in the WildAnimals module requires to be worked on and improved.  \\n6. The new behaviors created are all applied to deer as a placeholder for different animals. This needs to be tried out with different animals as soon as models and animations get ready. New behaviors can be created under the existing setup quite easily too.\\n\\nSome of these might be fixed by a long overdue movement refactoring. With Tyler Thompson\'s Scenario module developed alongside in [another GSoC project](https://thompsontyler.github.io/gsoc/2017/08/25/scenario-gsoc.html), the Lost module serves as an example of how a gameplay scenario can be made.  \\nWith the completion of this GSoC project making adventure assets like locked doors, traps, resurrection statues etc are now a lot more easier. Creation of more such things can probably serve as one of the tougher GCI tasks later.\\n\\n## Wrap Up\\n\\nMy favorite part of the summer was doing something I like and something I\'d have done anyway and at the same time availing the stipend and prestige of having done a GSoC.\\n\\nI would like to thank all my mentors. My primary mentor, Skylar ‘skysom’ Sommers, for replying always within a split second (save for the times when he forgets to hit the Send button :P). Florian ‘flo’ Köberle, who was my secondary but went out of his way and functioned effectively as my primary. I got to learn a lot from flo regarding various aspects of the game. It would have been impossible to complete my project without his aid. Xavier ‘xtariq’ Tariq, who was also my secondary mentor, helped me whenever I needed him. I’d like to especially thank Rasmus ‘cervator’ Praestholm here. Had he not been there that night in October, welcoming me on IRC and helping me set up my codebase, maybe I would have given up, moved on and never have done GSoC in the first place.\\n\\nAll in all, it has been a thrilling summer. By this time I am familiar with a good part of the game’s codebase. I would love to continue contributing, albeit in different capacities. Let’s hope real life doesn’t get in the way too much. Also, GCI is almost here and another storm’s coming!\\n\\nHere\'s one of the snaps from one of the multiplayer play test sessions-\\n\\n![](./multiplayerPlayTest.jpg)\\n\\n---\\n\\n> About the author:  \\n> Name: Nihal Singh (nihal111)  \\n> From: Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay  \\n> Social: [Github](https://github.com/nihal111) | [Blog](http://nihal111.github.io)  \\n"},{"path":"/blog/google-code-in-with-tiled","tags":["Update"],"posttype":"blog","cover":{"publicURL":"/ModuleSite/static/7a1748f57787e6b191d9f87d6bf63a50/cover.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/ModuleSite/static/7a1748f57787e6b191d9f87d6bf63a50/0611c/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/7a1748f57787e6b191d9f87d6bf63a50/3059d/cover.jpg 960w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/7a1748f57787e6b191d9f87d6bf63a50/a764f/cover.jpg 1920w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/7a1748f57787e6b191d9f87d6bf63a50/0611c/cover.jpg 3840w","sizes":"(min-width: 3840px) 3840px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/7a1748f57787e6b191d9f87d6bf63a50/bde8a/cover.webp 960w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/7a1748f57787e6b191d9f87d6bf63a50/c512e/cover.webp 1920w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/7a1748f57787e6b191d9f87d6bf63a50/bab97/cover.webp 3840w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 3840px) 3840px, 100vw"}]},"width":3840,"height":2160}}},"title":"Google Code-In with Tiled","author":"Thorbjørn Lindeijer","excerpt":"MovingBlocks is once again participating in Google Code-In this year.\\nGoogle Code-In is a program aimed at getting younger\\nstudents involved…","date":"2017-11-28","description":"MovingBlocks is once again participating in Google Code-In this year.

It has been an educational summer, and not just for the students :-)\\n\\n## UX Improvements by @ar0ne\\n\\n[Trello](https://trello.com/c/L6QIKSi0) | [GitHub Board](https://github.com/orgs/MovingBlocks/projects/12) | [Forum Thread](https://forum.terasology.org/threads/gsoc-2018-save-module-ux.2174) | [Final Report](https://ar0ne.github.io/gsoc/)\\n\\nSerj\'s project was an assortment of UI enhancements to make game selection and creation more informative. Saved games now have preview screenshots and a detail page with a wealth of information, including a bunch of extension points that can be added to in the future. Modules likewise now have a details screen, with a variety of utility like better dependency visibility and links to the module\'s homepage.\\n\\nThere was a fair amount of interaction and collaboration between this project and both the event recording and multi-world projects. All three to some degree are rooted in the game selection or creation UI flows. It seems to have been a very useful experience coordinating tweaks in the area, and as a result the involved code and associated UIs is vastly better today than when GSOC started!\\n\\nSee the final report or forum thread for a variety of screenshots. All changes are available in the latest game builds, with some outstanding issues and potential improvements [documented on GitHub](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues/3400)\\n\\n## Game-agnostic computer system by @asiekierka\\n\\n[Trello](https://trello.com/c/eve26hBR) | [GitHub Board](https://github.com/orgs/Terasology/projects/13) | [Forum Thread](https://forum.terasology.org/threads/gsoc-2018-frameworks-and-content.2175/) | [Final Report](https://forum.terasology.org/threads/gsoc-2018-frameworks-and-content.2175/#post-16063)\\n\\nOriginally Asie had actually submitted a proposal on a series of gameplay content frameworks akin to some prior work in Minecraft Modding, but analysis over the bonding period showed that too many dependent changes to the engine would be needed, making scope very tricky, especially as some parts would depend on specific contributors who would not necessarily be available on a timely basis. As a result we did a fruitful replanning session.\\n\\nBy the time the work period began the goal had changed to a single bigger gameplay system involving a in-game computer system that could be used both in Terasology and other games, such as our other game project [Destination Sol](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/DestinationSol)\\n\\nThe system works via a [Java Native Lua](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/JNLua) that runs virtually in-game with the ability to execute Lua scripts and interact with the game world. Thanks to the nice architecture a simulator can run out of game for testing as well, with adapters able to be written to support other games or other existing fantasy computer systems ([OpenComputers](https://ocdoc.cil.li/) is the current system supported)\\n\\n## Light & Shadow CTF by @dacharya64\\n\\n[Trello](https://trello.com/c/Dtyp7yiT) | [GitHub Board](https://github.com/orgs/Terasology/projects/11) | [Forum Thread](https://forum.terasology.org/threads/gsoc-2018-light-and-shadow.2166/) | [Final Report](http://dacharya64.postach.io/post/gsoc-final-project-wrapup)\\n\\nThis was another content project, focusing on making a replayable Capture The Flag (CTF) mode for our long-standing Light & Shadow game setting. Devi had to pick up an assortment of existing pieces plus add new ones while putting everything into a cohesive whole that would support the sort of gameplay you\'d expect with CTF. Relying entirely on multiplayer meant this project reached into the challenges of making everything work properly on the network.\\n\\nThe first big piece was better preparing the game world using an existing \\"spawn platform\\" (serving as a sort of lobby) and various artwork assets. Home bases exist for the two teams and you can teleport down to join a specific team. More world features are planned to make for a more interesting battlefield.\\n\\nA second large piece was making actual CTF functionality work, which is probably where most complexity snuck in, to make everything reliable in multiplayer. Players can steal flags from the enemy base, each other, and make a capture back at their home base. A player carrying a flag gets an awesome shower of particles to indicate they\'re the flag carrier! A double-screenie follows (flag carrier on left, flag chaser on right)\\n\\n![LightAndShadow](./LnS1.png)\\n\\n## Event recording and playback by @iaronaraujo\\n\\n[Trello](https://trello.com/c/zsp3wDNQ) | [GitHub Board](https://github.com/orgs/MovingBlocks/projects/13) | [Forum Thread](https://forum.terasology.org/threads/gsoc-2018-event-recording-proposal.2169/) | [Final Report](https://iaronaraujo.wixsite.com/meusite/blog/google-summer-of-code-2018-final-report)\\n\\nIaron worked on another highly technical project we were unsure about scope-wise, as the implementation could have gotten very sophisticated and tricky to pull off. Am thrilled it both worked and exceeded expectations! You can now start a recording session off an existing save game, take an arbitrary series of actions, then later have the game replay them - even on a different version of the game!\\n\\nThis should help us prepare acceptance tests as you can assert state during the replay to confirm that a thing did happen at a specific point and so forth. It even works using a headless game client, which was a welcome surprise! That lets us run the tests in our Jenkins during continuous integration.\\n\\nThere are still a couple directions it could be improved in to add further utility, chief among them being solely recording input events then replaying them on a _different_ world rather than start with a saved game. Then you could create standalone tests and re-run them in a variety of game configurations for more coverage.\\n\\n[Here](https://youtu.be/L6yO5B2p3nA) is a video showing a test being run, in this case with a headed game client (the test script drives the whole interaction, the user isn\'t doing anything but starting the test)\\n\\n<div class=\\"videowrapper\\">\\n    <iframe width=\\"1024\\" height=\\"768\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6yO5B2p3nA\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\"></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n## Server facade improvements by @Inei1\\n\\n[Trello](https://trello.com/c/FTMelamF) | [GitHub Board](https://github.com/orgs/MovingBlocks/projects/14) | [Forum Thread](https://forum.terasology.org/threads/gsoc-2018-improving-the-server-facade.2170/) | [Final Report](https://forum.terasology.org/threads/gsoc-2018-improving-the-server-facade.2170/#post-16059)\\n\\nTerasology actually uses a system of facades running in front of our engine, but it is rare anybody knows or even realizes this - which is the point! One of the alternatives to the regular PC application facade is an advanced server facade when you\'re hosting a headless instance of the game for multiplayer. Itself [mostly a product of GSOC 2017](https://forum.terasology.org/threads/facadeserver-headless-server-with-web-interface.1906) Neil added another round of improvements for 2018, mentored by the 2017 student Gianluca :-)\\n\\nWith GSOC 2018 complete when you use the advanced server facade you can now view a game map from a website, manage user permissions, administer the server config, whitelist/blacklist users, view resources consumed by the server, and so on. Cool stuff! This facade is now also bundled with the main game zip including executables to start the server the fancy way.\\n\\nThere are even unit tests! :D\\n\\n## Tower Defense by @jellysnake\\n\\n[Trello](https://trello.com/c/eNZ8Ww6r) | [GitHub Board](https://github.com/orgs/Terasology/projects/15) | [Forum Thread](https://forum.terasology.org/threads/gsoc-2018-tower-defence.2178/) | [Final Report](https://github.com/Terasology/GooeyDefence/wiki/Summer-of-Code)\\n\\nJelly put together maybe the most cohesive and replayable content Terasology now contains: a fun and engaging tower defense mode with nice visuals and a randomized play field. He also did this with a huge degree of independence while also producing naturally well-architected code and great documentation. A superbly well done project :-)\\n\\nThe header image from this blog post is from GooeyDefence. It is included in the latest builds, just pick it when creating a new game, `e` click the center shrine to progress in enemy waves, and buy tower parts through the inventory accessed with the `i` key. Go play it right now and let us know how you like it!\\n\\n## GooKeeper by @l0ftyWhizZ\\n\\n[Trello](https://trello.com/c/FOaU0sTs) | [GitHub Board](https://github.com/orgs/Terasology/projects/14) | [Forum Thread](https://forum.terasology.org/threads/gsoc-2018-gookeeper.2172) | [Final Report](https://gist.github.com/l0ftyWhizZ/121194027c49b2b11a4997b0e3e822bb)\\n\\nAnother one of the content projects this year was GooKeeper, a [recently introduced new game concept](https://forum.terasology.org/threads/gookeeper-game-concept.2099/) inspired some by Slime Rancher. Lofty did great work on several gameplay systems so you can create a zoo, invite in guests to visit pens and provide you with income, even breed new types of Gooeys.\\n\\nLike GooeyDefence this project is playable in the latest builds, so go nuts! :-) There is plenty of space to extend this (and all the content projects this year) into more creature types, pens, constraints on how you can design zoos, feed your critters, find them out in the wild, and so on.\\n\\nSee [the following video](https://youtu.be/aCRC0XGsadA) for a demonstration of the breeding system to make new types:\\n\\n<div class=\\"videowrapper\\">\\n    <iframe width=\\"1024\\" height=\\"768\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aCRC0XGsadA\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\"></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n## Master of Oreon overhaul by @Naman-sopho\\n\\n[Trello](https://trello.com/c/BhJebP9h) | [GitHub Board](https://github.com/orgs/Terasology/projects/10) | [Forum Thread](https://forum.terasology.org/threads/gsoc-2018-renovation-of-masteroforeon.2171/) | [Final Report](https://naman-sopho.github.io/2018-08-07-GSoCWrapUp/)\\n\\nThe final content project for GSOC 2018 is by Naman, and has the most potential for complex systems involving semi-autonomous creature societies, our very first stated ultimate game goal at long last - just took us 7 years to get here! ;-)\\n\\nThe initial state of gameplay contains the basics: a way to assign tasks to the Oreons, our first supported creature race, so they can help plant fields, harvest produce, construct buildings, guard areas, and so on. They need to eat after hard work and can improve their attributes over time. There is also a research system and a way to upgrade things.\\n\\nMore \\"gameplay loops\\" are needed to bring more depths to MOO, and thanks to Naman that\'s now something just about anybody can pick up to help out with! There\'s even an [awesome showcase video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5CGjjePnbA) introducing the concepts:\\n\\n<div class=\\"videowrapper\\">\\n    <iframe width=\\"1024\\" height=\\"768\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F5CGjjePnbA\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\"></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n## Multi-world support by @theflash98\\n\\n[Trello](https://trello.com/c/dYU1iOul) | [GitHub Board](https://github.com/orgs/MovingBlocks/projects/15) | [Forum Thread](https://forum.terasology.org/threads/gsoc-2018-multiple-worlds.2168/) | [Final Report](https://theflash98.github.io/main/2018/08/12/GSoC-Wrap-Up.html)\\n\\nFlash attacked another one of the technically complex topics: adding support for multiple independent worlds (planets, dimensions, etc) inside a single game. This had another set of uncertain effort points, where some things turned out easier than expected and others more difficult, to where great things were accomplished but full multi-world support still eludes us.\\n\\nFirst the game UI had to support further selections related to worlds, and this part resulted in more great UI improvements (see [video](https://youtu.be/bg8RBM4piMY) embedded below). The whole create game workflow was overhauled into a series of clear steps with a quick start now available right at the beginning. Huge UX win. Several related old bugs finally met their end!\\n\\nArchitecturally each world would get its own pool of entities and this now works and can even be demonstrated in-game. However the part that proved too much for the summer was how to separate out all the current world initialization steps to where they could happen independently within each world. Next after that we\'d then need the in-game logic to move players and such between worlds.\\n\\n<div class=\\"videowrapper\\">\\n    <iframe width=\\"1024\\" height=\\"768\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bg8RBM4piMY\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allowfullscreen=\\"\\"></iframe>\\n</div>\\n"},{"path":"/blog/happy-7-th-birthday-terasology","tags":["Update"],"posttype":"blog","cover":{"publicURL":"/ModuleSite/static/746ec60843c90a48ea118ca0cf80f6a9/cover.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/ModuleSite/static/746ec60843c90a48ea118ca0cf80f6a9/1624f/cover.png","srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/746ec60843c90a48ea118ca0cf80f6a9/aeb79/cover.png 400w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/746ec60843c90a48ea118ca0cf80f6a9/47126/cover.png 800w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/746ec60843c90a48ea118ca0cf80f6a9/1624f/cover.png 1600w","sizes":"(min-width: 1600px) 1600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/746ec60843c90a48ea118ca0cf80f6a9/dff21/cover.webp 400w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/746ec60843c90a48ea118ca0cf80f6a9/b2a35/cover.webp 800w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/746ec60843c90a48ea118ca0cf80f6a9/e9d78/cover.webp 1600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1600px) 1600px, 100vw"}]},"width":1600,"height":900}}},"title":"Happy 7th birthday Terasology!!","author":"Cervator","excerpt":"And ... first formal news post in a while, although it is starting out pretty small.

Aakash_\\n\\nWith “[Restoration 100]”, _E. Aakash_ tackles on of the core elements in every game: the player’s (in-game) health.\\nHe realized that no matter if a game mode uses hunger, thirst or health in general, this is always some kind of point pool that can be drained or filled.\\nThe target is to provide a well-defined API to other developers that want to use this concept in their modules or game modes.\\n\\n# UX and Tools\\n\\nEven the best games will not be played if you don’t provide good user experience and tooling around them.\\nHow to start the game?\\nHow to manage versions and updates?\\nWhat modules are trending?\\n\\n## Module Showcase Website by _majordwarf_\\n\\nTerasology’s basic engine can be extended by a huge amount (201 right now!) of modules.\\nKeeping track of them is not the easiest task.\\nThis is why _majordwarf_ plans to provide an automated generator for a website, listing all of them.\\nThis [showcase] website will increase discoverability by allowing to filter and search for modules by keywords and categories.\\n\\n## Terasology Launcher 4.0 by _Priyadarshi Raj_\\n\\nOur launcher has gone through multiple changes up to now and there’s another one waiting right ahead: _Priydarshi Raj_ will not only modernize the UI, but also integrate server and game management.\\nFurthermore, the launcher will be self-contained in the future without the need to download and set-up additional software such as Java.\\n\\n![Launcher 4.0](./launcher-4.0-mockup.png)\\n\\n# Technology\\n\\nTechnical parts that reside in the depth of Terasology’s implementation may not be (immediately) visible to players but are crucial for all the individual gears of the project to interlock.\\nThe final two projects are tinkering with things under the hood.\\n\\n## Collective Behavior by _casals_\\n\\n_casals_ is our first-ever GSoC PhD student.\\nHe plans to bring in [collective behaviour] concepts to be used among multiple actors.\\nIn his words: “Collective behavior can be illustrated by a pack of jackals: depending on a certain criteria being satisfied (number of jackals in the pack, number of preys/enemies around), they can either decide to attack or to flee - as a group.

Now that the summer is over, it\'s time to summarize what has happened. But first of all: we are very happy to thank all our nine students for their contributions to [The Terasology Foundation], and we want to congratulate them for successfully finishing a Summer of Code!\\n\\n> _Just a short reminder of what [GSOC] actually is:_ > _in a 3-month program sponsored by Google, students from all over the world are motivated to join open-source organizations and thrive on real-world software development challenges._ > _Organizations and students find each other, interact directly, and build and improve FOSS projects._\\n\\nA video game might seem to offer a restricted range of topics to work on, but quite the contrary is the case.\\nOur students were working on different areas all over our code base, including additional content and game modes as well as improving user experience and tinkering with under-the-hood technologies.\\nLet\'s visit them one-by-one ...\\n\\n## Technology\\n\\nTechnical parts that reside in the depth of Terasology’s implementation may not be (immediately) visible to players but are crucial for all the individual gears of the project to interlock.\\nThe first two projects we want to highlight fit into this very technology-heavy category.\\n\\nThe best part about _David S_\' project on enhancing the **Render DAG** is that we don\'t see it.\\nThat might sound weird at first, but making the rendering architecture modular should ideally not change its behavior.\\nAs a result, we can connect frame buffers freely to rendering nodes at runtime.\\nIn case you ever wondered what such a graph looks like - here you go 🤓\\n\\n![Rendering DAG](2019_gsoc_rendering-dag.jpg)\\n\\nContinuing our game dev buzz word bingo: next up is an AI project on **Collective Behavior**.\\n_casals_ was clever enough to find a suitable project close to his research topic, but that does not mean it was all easy cruising.\\nOver the course of three months the concept of Behavior Trees was extended to be also applicable to groups.\\nTo showcase the development, the WildAnimals module was extended (oh deer 🦌).\\nTutorials are updated and examples provided, so we hope to see our mobs stepping up a bit.\\n\\n## UX and Tooling\\n\\nWhen talking about game development one should not forget about the tasks that\\nare not focused on graphics and rendering, but put the player in the center:\\nHow to start the game?\\nHow to manage versions and updates?\\nWhat modules are trending?\\n\\nStudent _Priydarshi Raj_ put his hands on the **Launcher 4.0**, starting with a UI redesign.\\nThe topic soon derailed a bit and ended up being focused on bundling the Java Runtime and providing a re-implementation of the game downloader and package manager.\\nThis means that the launcher is now self-contained - no hassle with debugging your local Java version anymore!\\nHowever, we have to wait a bit longer for the complete dark UI theme.\\n\\nThe **Module Showcase Website** by _majordwarf_ made up for the missing UI overhaul in the Launcher, though, and provides some visual novelty.\\nInitially, it was scoped to provide a website to make our modules discoverable.\\nIt ended up with a wider scope, drafting an overhaul for our website with the module showcase section just being one part of it.\\nIn the future, this should help players to keep track of the vast amount of modules and extensions (201 right now!) that are available for Terasology.\\n\\n![Module Showcase Website and Blog](2019_gsoc_module-showcase.jpg)\\n\\n## Content\\n\\nAnother one of our busy student bees during this year\'s Google Summer of Code was _Cameron McWilliams_.\\nAs the main part of his **Apiculture** project he created a whole new family of species that can be integrated in Terasology gameplay: bees! 🐝\\nBees are associated with a specific species, have a fixed lifespan and can have offspring.\\nAs some species of bees are not as common as others, the other part of his project enables a player to bee (pun intended) a scientist and take a dive into the hive of genetics.\\nBy use of the extractor and injector tool, the player can extract gene samples and inject them into other bees, allowing to beed... sorry, breed... rare species with especially desirable traits.\\n\\nHealth restoration (being healed) and regeneration (healing) used to be the same thing for a long time in Terasology.\\nBut now that summer is over and _E. Aakash\'s_ **Health Overhaul** is in place, things are different.\\nThe game now has a different cycle for each of these two effects, allowing to associate them with different events and individually configure or even disable them, depending on the game mode.\\nIn addition, he documented his take on possible implementations for a point pool as the backbone for point-based systems, such as hunger, thirst and - who would have thought it possible - health.\\nNaturally, this list is not complete and grows as per the imagination of our module developers, e.g. air (underwater), mana, stamina, etc.\\n\\n## Game Modes\\n\\n![LaS Arena](2019_gsoc_las-arena.jpg)\\n\\n_darshan3_ took it on him to develop the visual and lore-based ideas of **Light and Shadow** into an independent capture-the-flag-style game mode.\\nHe built an arena in which the teams can battle for the precious flag with the help of towers or weapons such as the Spades Staff that repels or the Diamonds Staff that stuns enemies.\\nPlayers can also see enemies drawing closer on the now multiplayer-enabled minimap.\\nSoon, players can futhermore barter resources to get new items in the (currently almost completed) markets.\\nLoving statistics, we also approve of the game over screen, listing kills and deaths for each player! 👍\\n\\nOur brand new game mode **Metal Renegades** was tackled by no less than two students - naturally on different ends of the project.\\nThis proved beneficial for both the progress of the game mode development and the students\' skill to find the right scope for their work (and communicating it).\\n\\n_AndyTechGuy_ busied himself with the behavior of faction-affiliated NPCs as well as needs for both NPCs and players alike.\\nThe in-game cities are now brought to life with scared (run, forrest, run! 🏃‍♂️), hostile (this is sparta! 😤), friendly (I, I follow, I follow you 🤗) or simply straying (where is Lady, you tramp? 🐶) NPCs.\\nAnd as soon as they go to sleep in the evening, the nocturnals come out to play 😉\\nAll of the differently behaving NPCs feel the same needs as a now player might: hunger and thirst.\\nThey even get lonely and seek a fellow citizens proximity - naturally only if they are of the same faction... else: spartaaa!\\n\\n\x3c!-- ![Metal Renegades Shooting Action](2019_gsoc_metal-renegades.gif){:height=\\"50%\\" width=\\"50%\\"}  --\x3e\\n<img src=\\"2019_gsoc_metal-renegades.gif\\" width=\\"650\\" >\\n\\nMeanwhile, _Mayant Mukul_ worked on connecting dynamically created cities with rails that even run locomotive carts (tchuff tchuff 🚂).\\nMoreover, he added weapons such as pistols and gatlings (pew pew pew) and introduced currency with which every player can now not only fill his or her brand new wallet, but also buy items by trading with the NPCs.\\nBut watch out, whatever you carry around with you: if you die, you don\'t take it to the grave with you - it drops onto the ground for anybody to pick up.\\n\\n---\\n\\n> _The way students report their progress is determined by the student and their mentors.

We took the opportunity of the Google\\nSummer of Code **Mentor Summit** and added our own little **TeraCon** meetup in the Bavarian capital.

Read on for more details on our little TeraCon meet-up and the Mentor\\nSummit._\\n\\n## TeraCon 2019 - Munich Edition\\n\\n### Monday, October 14\\n\\nThe first Terasologist to arrive in Munich is eviltak. After some hours of flight and an unexpectedly long time in the\\nwaiting line at immigrations, he is the first to check-in. Three hours later, skaldarnar and niruandaleth join him in\\nthe AirBnB after a five hours train ride through the country and stopping by the grocery store. After some short\\nintroductions and setting up the chromecast, we get to work: eviltak explains the new [AutoConfigPR] which replaces the\\nprevious [FlexibleConfigs], while skaldarnar and niruandaleth begin to cook spaghetti bolognese; soon the PR is merged\\nand dinner is served - adhering to bavarian \\"tradition\\" - accompanied by a glass of beer ;) A bit later qwc also joins\\nthe crowd, leaving jellysnake as the only Terasologist still missing in our crew. The remaining evening is mainly filled\\nwith recalling the focus and extent of the tasks of previous years\' GCI and discussing what we learnt from those years\\nand what we want to do different for this year\'s GCI.\\n\\n![Terasologists at Work - part 1](munich_group_01.jpg)\\n\\n### Tuesday, October 15\\n\\nThe second day of our stay in Munich starts with a nice breakfast outside on the balcony with scrambled eggs, toast and\\na lot of sunshine ☀️. While eviltak goes out exploring the bavarian capital, the other three of us stay in to code. As\\nskaldarnar and niruandaleth have to work for their day-job, however, the only one actually making progress with\\nTerasology is qwc by cleaning up his server and the docker build stuff on it. In the evening we get together again to do\\na first playtest - well... try to at least. While qwc and niruandaleth experience some strange world generation issues\\nwhen starting up Light & Shadow, the daytime adventuring through Munich soon takes its toll on eviltak and he (in his\\nown words) \\"falls asleep basically right on his face\\". Eventually, skaldarnar and qwc manage to play a first round of\\nLight & Shadow capture the flag. With regard to jellysnakes estimated arrival early next morning and the necessity of a\\ngood night\'s sleep to have a productive TeraCon, though, further rounds are postponed in favor of heading to bed early.\\n\\n![Terasologists at Work - part 2](munich_group_02.jpg )\\n\\n### Wednesday, October 16\\n\\nThis year\'s TeraCon started early with jellysnake arriving at 8 o\'clock german time. After a quick introduction round\\nand a few slices of toast for breakfast, we set up qwc\'s spare laptop to go through all the open PRs in the Terasology\\nCore repository with everybody being able to take notes, check related issues or updating the communication channels at\\nthe same time. Soon we had a list of all PRs, annotated with \\"merged\\", \\"closed\\" or \\"revisit\\" - first round of\\n[Merge-athon] efforts done, check. Next up was a quick update for jellysnake on the results of Monday\'s GCI discussions,\\nfollowed by a first GCI Trello board clean-up effort and another discussion round. This time we dove deeper into the GCI\\ntopic and thought about what possible GCI tasks and task chains could look like, which of the three levels \\"beginner\\",\\n\\"learning\\"/\\"tutorial\\", and \\"productive\\" to put these tasks in and how to precisely communicate acceptance and rejection\\ncriteria. After enjoying some slices of yummy pizza, we continued with play-testing both Light & Shadow and Metal\\nRenegades. For both play-tests we listed issues we encountered. Together we were able to in-game debug and sometimes\\neven pinpoint the exact problem. Later-on qwc even started writing out issues respectively.\\n\\n![Pizza](munich_pizza.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Google Mentor Summit\\n\\nThe remainder of the week was reserved for the [Mentor Summit], hosted by Google at the Marriott Hotel Munich.\\nUnfortunately, _vampcat_ could not attend, so _skaldarnar_ dropped in and joined _eviltak_ and _jellysnake_  for the\\nfun. We were among 318 attendees from 42 countries! The 10 Google volunteers made a great job organizing everything and\\ngiving us a great time - Thanks to all of you!\\n\\nMeeting so many other open source enthusiasts was an exciting experience to us all. Be it fellow game developers from\\n[Godot Engine], scientists from [PEcAn] who study ecosystems from crops to forests, or tech-talk about Gradle and JavaFX\\nwith some new friends from [JabRef]. But it was not only just talking - we tried out the [Checker Framework] on the spot\\nin [MovingBlocks/Terasology#3769], leading to a small improvement merged in [MovingBlocks/Terasology#3769].\\n\\n![](munich_mentor-summit-stage.jpg)\\n\\nBesides some fun activities such as a scavenger hunt through Munich or a castle tour the mentor summit is an\\n**unconference**. There is no predefined schedule (beside lunch time, of course 🍔🥗) the attendees have to follow.\\nInstead, everything is self-organized. You can find an overview of the [Mentor Summit Sessions] online, and many notes\\nare shared as well. Two sessions were hosted by us: _eviltak_ asked the question how short-term contributors can be\\nempowered to make high impact contributions, and _skaldarnar_ initiated a discussion on how to estimate contributor\\npotential (where is their strength, how to guide them, ...?).\\n\\nAll the lively discussions motivated _jellysnake_ and _skaldarnar_ to spent some additional hours on bug fixes and new\\nfeatures. Spontaneous coding in the hotel lobby or at the coffee table was fun and refreshing, resulting in a [new\\n`BlockFamily`][MovingBlocks/Terasology#3771] which will allow for upside-down stairs 😃 Keep an eye out for more changes\\nto come while the Merge-athon continues 😉\\n\\n\x3c!-- References --\x3e\\n[AutoConfigPR]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/3723\\n[Checker Framework]: https://checkerframework.org/\\n[DestSol]: http://destinationsol.org/\\n[FlexibleConfigs]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues/2668\\n[Godot Engine]: https://godotengine.org/\\n[GSOC]: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/\\n[JabRef]: http://www.jabref.org/\\n[Mentor Summit Sessions]: https://sites.google.com/view/gsoc-mentorsummit2019/more-info/session-notes\\n[Mentor Summit]: https://sites.google.com/view/gsoc-mentorsummit2019/home\\n[Merge-athon]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues/3737\\n[MovingBlocks/Terasology#3769]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/3769\\n[MovingBlocks/Terasology#3770]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/3770\\n[MovingBlocks/Terasology#3771]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/3771\\n[PEcAn]: https://pecanproject.github.io/\\n[PRs-created]: https://github.com/search?q=org%3AMovingBlocks+org%3ATerasology+is%3Apr+created%3A2019-10-14..2019-10-20+is%3Aopen&type=Issues\\n[PRs-merged]: https://github.com/search?q=org%3AMovingBlocks+org%3ATerasology+is%3Apr+created%3A2019-10-14..2019-10-20+is%3Amerged&type=Issues\\n[Terasology Launcher]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TerasologyLauncher\\n[Terasology]: https://terasology.org\\n[The Terasology Foundation]: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4777549354237952\\n"},{"path":"/blog/tera-saturday-1","tags":["TeraSaturday"],"posttype":"blog","cover":{"publicURL":"/ModuleSite/static/86f27ac4c89ff64db1c2de4276891f00/cover.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/ModuleSite/static/86f27ac4c89ff64db1c2de4276891f00/a764f/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/86f27ac4c89ff64db1c2de4276891f00/fb67e/cover.jpg 480w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/86f27ac4c89ff64db1c2de4276891f00/3059d/cover.jpg 960w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/86f27ac4c89ff64db1c2de4276891f00/a764f/cover.jpg 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/86f27ac4c89ff64db1c2de4276891f00/3a3a2/cover.webp 480w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/86f27ac4c89ff64db1c2de4276891f00/bde8a/cover.webp 960w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/86f27ac4c89ff64db1c2de4276891f00/c512e/cover.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"}]},"width":1920,"height":1080}}},"title":"TeraSaturday #1","author":"Jordan H.

But hopefully it will still meet your coolness expectations._\\n\\n---\\n\\n* The biggest Terasology news this week is that it marks the end of this year\'s Google Code-In, and a big _thank you!_ \\ngoes out to everyone who participated, students and mentors alike! It\'s been great helping everyone experiment and learn\\nover the past couple of months, and I certainly hope to see everyone more in the future.\\n\\n## New Features (The Fun Stuff)\\n\\n* If you\'ve been making new block shapes lately, you\'ve probably become familiar with the challenges of our old Blender\\nplugin. It\'s not compatible with the current version of Blender, it\'s tricky to install, and getting things to rotate\\nproperly can be messy. Like making a banana smoothie without a lid. And so you\'ll probably be glad to hear that Pollend \\nand I have released the first beta version of a brand new [Blender Block Shape Plugin] for Blender 2.8. \\n\\n![The plugin in action](blender_block_plugin.png)\\n\\n* It can be installed normally from Blender\'s addon menu, it can import and export all the basic engine shapes without \\ngetting confused about which way is up, and it is 100% laser-shark-free, guaranteed. There is no such guarantee about \\nbugs, however. So if you spot one, make sure you jump on a table and scream at us to squish it. _(Or just [create an\\nissue] in the GitHub repo. We\'re more likely to hear you that way.)_\\n\\n---\\n\\n![Fancy trees and stuff](grass_color.png)\\n\\n* Leaves and grass have looked a little sad and dead since the BiomesAPI update last May removed block colorization. \\nIt was an unfortunate side-effect of progress; since biomes were no longer part of the engine, the engine could not\\nrely on the biome to tell it what colors the grass should be. But vibrant plants are sacrificed no more! They have\\nreturned, relying upon the humidity and temperature directly instead of the biome.\\n\\n---\\n\\n![Cotton](cotton.png)\\n\\n* That is not the only way in which the basic flora has improved this week. [Cotton] textures in CoreAssets have been\\nreplaced with brand new art from TheStygianHawk.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n<img src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17286005/72514970-de110d80-389a-11ea-83c4-1376126fdfbb.png\\" alt=\\"An example of torches generated with askneller\'s work\\" style=\\"width:80%\\">\\n\\n* New contributor askneller is working on better cave generation; as an intermediary step, world generating rasterizers\\n (the systems that place the specific blocks) [can depend on another rasterizer][MovingBlocks/Terasology#3825] which \\n must run first. This is important, because if you try to decorate your caves before you have any caves to decorate, \\n you\'re going to wind up with an empty cave and a visit from the Time Police for violating the laws of cause and effect. \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Bugfixes and Optimizations (The Nerdy Stuff)\\n\\n![0 stars do not recommend these snacks](soap_mint.png)\\n\\n* Adrijaned has made improvements to the [asset loading system][MovingBlocks/Terasology#3589], including lots of \\ndocumentation in an area that definitely needed more of it. Even for clever devs like _(ahem)_ yours truly, figuring out\\nhow to use code without any documentation is often bitter and confusing. Like those little soap-flavored mints on hotel\\npillows. Always comment your code, kids. Don\'t make soap-flavored mints.\\n\\n---\\n\\n* BenjaminAmos has done similar work over in the [Sensors] module. So if you\'re into creating monsters that watch from\\nthe shadows, or traps that activate when you step on them, or raptors that perform laser eye surgery when they see a\\nshark, now you can proceed while knowing what you\'re doing. _(Knowing **why** you\'re doing it is something you\'ll have\\nto figure out on your own. We can\'t help you there, sorry.)_\\n\\n---\\n\\n* DarkWeird has [streamlined the chunk loading process][MovingBlocks/Terasology#3804] for worlds that have already been \\ngenerated, which should be noticeably better at loading more of the world faster in multiplayer games when players are \\nfar apart, or if you happen to be playing Terasology on a potato or a toaster. _(Unfortunately, we do not, at this time, \\nsupport playing Terasology on toasted potatoes. Potato toasters, however, are fine.)_\\n\\n---\\n\\n* Pollend has [optimized the Discord Rich Presence integration][MovingBlocks/Terasology#3821], which reduces Terasology\'s\\n overall CPU usage by up to 2%. _(Note for future developers: increasing a counter to 5000 every millisecond instead of\\n just waiting 5 seconds is... not fast. So don\'t do that. Please. Your CPU will thank you. Not literally, because that\\n would be creepy. It\'ll thank you in a non-verbal metaphorical way. By working faster. That is all.)_\\n \\n---\\n \\n* [Windows XP users][MovingBlocks/Terasology#3823] might be able to play Terasology again, thanks to sladyn98. There\'s\\njust one problem... none of us has a Windows XP system lying around anymore to fix it. _(Not even the people with potatoes \\nand toasters.)_ So if you or a loved one has been diagnosed with Microsoft Windows XP, you may be entitled to confirmation.\\nPlease, try it out and let us know if it works.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThus concludes the first TeraSaturday changeblog. Hopefully, despite the absence of flashy lights and fierce creatures, \\nyour thirst for coolness has been satiated. _(If not, I recommend a low-calorie sports drink.)_ Enjoy the game, and I\'ll \\nbe back for another update next week!\\n\\n\x3c!-- References --\x3e\\n[Blender Block Shape Plugin]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/BlenderAddon/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta\\n[create an issue]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/BlenderAddon/\\n[MovingBlocks/Terasology#3589]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/3589\\n[MovingBlocks/Terasology#3802]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/3802\\n[MovingBlocks/Terasology#3804]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/3804\\n[MovingBlocks/Terasology#3821]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/3821\\n[MovingBlocks/Terasology#3823]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/3823\\n[MovingBlocks/Terasology#3825]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/3825\\n[Sensors]: https://github.com/Terasology/Sensors/pull/4\\n[Cotton]: https://github.com/Terasology/CoreAssets/commit/5e94cef5ef278a8dd7e93321689882493a97968d"},{"path":"/blog/tera-saturday-2","tags":["TeraSaturday"],"posttype":"blog","cover":{"publicURL":"/ModuleSite/static/fbb9a0ae303eacb4f25d5ee8f6ff933c/cover.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/ModuleSite/static/fbb9a0ae303eacb4f25d5ee8f6ff933c/a764f/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/fbb9a0ae303eacb4f25d5ee8f6ff933c/fb67e/cover.jpg 480w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/fbb9a0ae303eacb4f25d5ee8f6ff933c/3059d/cover.jpg 960w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/fbb9a0ae303eacb4f25d5ee8f6ff933c/a764f/cover.jpg 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/fbb9a0ae303eacb4f25d5ee8f6ff933c/3a3a2/cover.webp 480w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/fbb9a0ae303eacb4f25d5ee8f6ff933c/bde8a/cover.webp 960w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/fbb9a0ae303eacb4f25d5ee8f6ff933c/c512e/cover.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"}]},"width":1920,"height":1080}}},"title":"TeraSaturday #2","author":"Jordan H.

Stay tuned!\\n\\n## New Features (The Fun Stuff)\\n\\n* Sladyn98 has been been working on the ability to easily set up and connect to [multiplayer servers over LAN].

There are some quirks to work out with converting Blender\'s\\ndata structures to Terasology\'s block shape structure; since Blender stores all the UV and normal data per *face* instead\\nof per *vertex,* it may need an update or two to the .shape format. But, if all goes as planned, all the old .shape files \\nwill still work fine _(no need for another massive file conversion like when all the blocks in the Core module got moved \\nto CoreBlocks!)_ and new .shape files will be able to handle multiple UV locations per vertex. _(In words that less geeky,\\nthat means we\'ll be able to have more advanced textures and lighting for blocks with complex shapes. Shiny shiny.)_\\n\\n---\\n<img src=\\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/270264625419911192/666236136057733150/unknown.png\\" alt=\\"Inferno!\\" style=\\"width:800px;padding:8px\\" >\\n\\n\\n* Pardon me for being blunt... but if you download this module update, you can go to hell. No, really -- it\'s once again\\npossible to visit iojw\'s fiery [Inferno] now that Torpedo99 has fixed the spawning mechanism! You might ask, _how do you\\nexpect me to travel to this dimension of shadow and lava? You don\'t really expect me to construct some sort of portal, \\ndo you?_ No, Mr. Goo, I expect you to die. Once you reach 0 health, you\'ll respawn in the Inferno!\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Bugfixes and Optimizations (The Nerdy Stuff)\\n\\n* Naman-sopho has fixed some bugs in [Master of Oreon] by giving your alien builders the ability to properly order their\\nto-do lists, so that they don\'t get overwhelmed and confused when you give them more than one task. Take your time, \\nOreons. Alien Rome wasn\'t built in a day.\\n\\n---\\n\\n* My side-project over in [NameGenerator] has been cleaned up a little more. We\'re still a long way out from having\\nprocedurally-generated animal species, so no, you still won\'t be able to hunt down a South Ecuadorian Giant Laser Shark \\nany time soon. _(Nor do you have to worry about being hunted down by any South Ecuadorian Giant Laser Sharks. Unless you\'re\\nexploring evil lairs in South Ecuador, of course.)_ But if you want to make [cities] or NPCs that have names from Ancient \\nGreece, Ancient Rome, Ancient Egypt, medieval Japan, modern Hindi, or a few other cultures, you\'ll soon be able to grab \\nthem from the new templates.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThus concludes the second TeraSaturday changeblog.

Right: you come back and do the work!\\nWe\'re happy to welcome back _AndyTechGuy_, who after focusing on the initial technical implementation of the Metal Renegades gameplay last year, intends to [refine the content and game experience] this year.\\n\\n![Metal Renegades](mr_good-bad-gooey.png)\\n\\nThe first objective will be to motivate the player to get active.\\nThe wild wild west is no bed of roses, so hunger, thirst and nightly dangers in the barren surroundings will have the player work hard to survive.\\nThis also brings us to the next point: giving Metal Renegades a better feel to it using discoverables outside the cities, improved NPC personality and making cities, surroundings and the interaction with them more realistic.\\nLast but not least, the gameplay is currently highly affected by performance and NPC pathfinding issues, that the student will analyze and attempt to fix.\\n\\n\\n# Biome-specific Content Enhancements for Terasology\\n## - by _ktksan_\\n\\nWhile exploring a world in Terasology, you can find a variety of biomes (with the respective module enabled of course), ranging from snow over plains and mountains to beaches and deserts.\\nAnd while these biomes are nice to look at and a welcome change of scene, they currently don\'t have much of an effect on the player.\\n\\n![Climate Effects](2020_gsoc_climate-effects.png)\\n\\n_ktksan_ will introduce [biome-specific content] in the form of climate effects for both very cold and very hot biomes, that will induce obstacles such as hypothermia or heat strokes the player will succumb to and perish if they don\'t find means to overcome them.\\nTo motivate players to take on the risk or put in the effort to craft equipment to counter the climate effects, special structures like an oasis or an igloo settlement with hidden treasures will be added to the respective biomes.\\nEquipment like woolen clothes and water skins to keep warm or hydrated will be craftable by leveraging flora and fauna of other, more habitable biomes.\\n\\n\\n# Genome Expansion\\n## - by _Vedant Shroff_\\n\\nYou want to breed animals to maximize their genetic potential?\\nWell, as we like to say: \\"We have a module for that!\\"\\nActually, that\'s incorrect... we have _two_ modules for that - which is a common situation (read: issue) to be honest 😅\\n\\n![Genome Expansion](2020_gsoc_genome-expansion.png)\\n\\nIn their GSOC project, _Vedant Shroff_ intends to not only unify these two modules to be able to leverage the advantages of both, but also [expand the genome aspect] by integration the result with our modules for farming and edibles.\\nThis will allow players to also \\"breed\\" plants and immerse in the gameplay experience of crafting ideal food sources.\\nMay the genes be strong in these plants... ehh, plans.\\n\\n\\n# Terasology Game Hud, Graphics Improvement & Gameplay Guide\\n## - by _Stefania Mak_\\n\\nAs the bunch of mostly (technically and content-) focused developers that we are, we lacked an eye for user experience (UX) and appealing user interfaces (UI) for a long time.\\nBut no more, now that _Stefania Mak_ joined us and plans to turn Terasology visuals topsy-turvy.\\n\\n![HUD overhaul](2020_gsoc_hud-overhaul.png)\\n\\nTerasology is largely perceived as a Minecraft clone and often we reduce our project to exactly that in our minds - but it is so much more.\\nTo dissolve this tight association with Minecraft, improve UI/UX and bring Terasology closer to a distinct identity and style, the student will focus on [overhauling the game\'s Head-up-Display (HUD) and menu screens].\\n\\n\\n# Interactive Journey in Terasology Contributions\\n## - by _Pratham Sahasrabhojane_\\n\\nContributing to an open source project is very rewarding, but in the beginning it is also hard and confusing.\\nThe more complex a project and its codebase and the more numerous the contribution possibilities, the more difficult it is to find a good starting point or resources for an easy immersion into the project.\\n\\n![Interactive Contributor Journey](2020_gsoc_tutorial-journey.png)\\n\\n_Pratham Sahasrabhojane_ plans to change that by providing an [interactive journey for (new) contributors] to get information and directions to possible contribution paths corresponding to their ambitions.\\nThrough a dialogue with the contributor, the resulting app shall point them to documentation and tutorials to get familiar with the aspects of Terasology in their area of interest.\\n\\n\\n# Converting \\"Destination: Sol\\" systems to use ECS\\n## - by _Isaac lichter_\\n\\nWe\'re very happy to also have a GSOC project this year that targets _Destination: Sol_ ([DestSol]), the arcade space shooter maintained by _The Terasology Foundation_.\\nIn 2015, _The Terasology Foundation_ (at that time \\"MovingBlocks\\") offered infrastructure and maintenance to original author Milosh Petrov.\\nSince then, there have been many contributions to DestSol, but it never made use of the foundation\'s [_Gestalt_ library] - until now.\\n\\n![DestSol](2020_gsoc_dest-sol.png)\\n\\n_Isaac lichter_ will [incorporate the _Entity-Component-System_ (ECS) provided by _Gestalt_] by refactoring central aspects of the game.\\nTo enable other contributors to join the efforts of porting the whole game to ECS, the student will furthermore write a portation guide on how to integrate with Gestalt\'s ECS.\\n\\n---\\n\\n> _The way students report their progress is determined by the student and their mentors.

Half blog, half changelog, completely cool._\\n\\n------------------------\\n\\n* It\'s been a lot longer than I intended since I put together the last TeraSaturday post. Some quiet weeks, some buggy \\nweeks, some apocalyptic weeks! There\'s been a lot that\'s happened in the interim, but there\'s one \\nrecent project that deserves the most attention first:\\n\\n## The Core Explosion\\n\\nFor years, the Core module of Terasology contained everything needed for some simple gameplay. Basic world generators, \\nthe inventory system, grass and stone and trees and chests and all that fun stuff. Even dynamite! There was a bit of a \\nproblem, though, in that not every game mode *needs* all those things. They might use a completely different world \\ngenerator, or have a different inventory system, or they don\'t want to have players blowing things up. So about a year \\nand a half ago, we began mining out the Core.\\n\\nJellysnake separated [Inventory] from Core, and Adrijaned pulled out Biomes. [Health] got its own fresh new module thanks\\n to e-aakash. I pulled out all the world blocks, creating the CoreBlocks module, and CoreAssets for the textures and \\n sounds they used. That was a big project, requiring updates to over 50 different modules!\\n\\nThis was _bigger._\\n\\n![just a small part of the changes!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/696830442065625118/712674385391255562/unknown.png)\\n\\nTaking the extraction to its logical conclusion, Skaldarnar and Niruandaleth have completely removed the Core module. \\nCoreBlocks has been blown up, too. In their place, a new network of modules stretches across the workspace, each \\nproviding a specific subset of functionality for the Core Gameplay preset.\\n\\n<img src=\\"https://i.imgur.com/qBHbynr.png\\" alt=\\"New Core Module Diagram\\" style=\\"width:800px;padding:8px\\">\\n\\nThe old Inventory and LootPools modules, used to keep track of items, have been mixed together and separated again, \\nforming a refreshed [Inventory] module and a new [Drops] module.\\n\\nCoreBlocks has been divided and conquered. Basic blocks like dirt, stone, sand, and wood have gone directly into \\n[CoreAssets], while fancy blocks like chests and doors and TNT have gone into [CoreAdvancedAssets]. \\n_(Yes, the name is still a work in progress.)_\\n\\nThe new modules of [Furnishings] and [Explosives] hold the game logic that those fancy blocks need to work, so other modules\\n can make their own storage, doors, or bombs without needing to keep the basic versions around too. All the \\n world-builders have been moved to the aptly-named [CoreWorlds]. All together, [CoreSampleGameplay] combines this new \\n collection of modules into the same base gameplay setting that existed before.\\n \\nIf you\'re just playing the game, you probably won\'t notice much of a difference before and after. But for module \\ndevelopers, it opens a lot of doors (and chests!) for making more cool stuff, more efficiently.\\n\\n\x3c!-- References --\x3e\\n[CoreAdvancedAssets]: https://github.com/Terasology/CoreAdvancedAssets\\n[CoreAssets]: https://github.com/Terasology/CoreAssets\\n[CoreSampleGameplay]: https://github.com/Terasology/CoreAssets\\n[CoreWorlds]: https://github.com/Terasology/CoreWorlds\\n[Drops]: https://github.com/Terasology/Drops\\n[Explosives]: https://github.com/Terasology/Explosives\\n[Inventory]: https://github.com/Terasology/Inventory\\n[Furnishings]: https://github.com/Terasology/Furnishings\\n[Health]: https://github.com/Terasology/Health"},{"path":"/blog/tera-saturday-4-the-gradle-will-rock","tags":["TeraSaturday"],"posttype":"blog","cover":{"publicURL":"/ModuleSite/static/a209920ea7919ddabae0623e1a96c17d/cover.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8d8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/ModuleSite/static/a209920ea7919ddabae0623e1a96c17d/a764f/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/a209920ea7919ddabae0623e1a96c17d/fb67e/cover.jpg 480w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/a209920ea7919ddabae0623e1a96c17d/3059d/cover.jpg 960w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/a209920ea7919ddabae0623e1a96c17d/a764f/cover.jpg 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/a209920ea7919ddabae0623e1a96c17d/3a3a2/cover.webp 480w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/a209920ea7919ddabae0623e1a96c17d/bde8a/cover.webp 960w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/a209920ea7919ddabae0623e1a96c17d/c512e/cover.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"}]},"width":1920,"height":1080}}},"title":"TeraSaturday #4: The Gradle Will Rock","author":"Jordan H.

Keturn, DarkWeird, and of course Cervator have led the way towards further integration of project setup\\nand IDE.\\n\\nIn the past, our setup of IntelliJ IDEA and Gradle has not interacted very smoothly.

The basic supported versions of Gradle and Java have been updated -- our Gradle wrapper should now use \\nGradle 6.4, and while Terasology still supports Java 8, it should work a lot better on Java 11 now, too. Starting with \\n[IDEA 2020.1], it\'s possible to download and install specific versions of the Java Development Kit right from the IDE, \\nmaking it much easier to set up a consistent project environment.\\n\\nBecause of all these changes, the process to set up a new Terasology workspace has changed. Here\'s the new process:\\n\\n- As always, you\'ll first need to download the [engine repository], which you can do by either [downloading from GitHub]\\nor by [fetching with git].\\n\\n- Once you have the engine downloaded, you\'ll be left with... just that, an empty engine without any modules. To set up\\nwith the basics, you\'ll need to run `groovyw module init iota` in your choice of command prompt. To set up EVERYTHING\\nthat is ready for gameplay (which will take a lot longer!) you can instead run `groovyw module init omega`.\\n\\n- To add any modules not included in your distribution choice, such as (for example) *JoshariasSurvival*, running\\n `groovyw module recurse JoshariasSurvival` will fetch all the modules used by JS in source form.\\n \\n - When opening the project in IDEA, make sure to \\"Import Gradle Project\\".\\n \\n - If launching the game from the IDE gives you any problems, or if you aren\'t using IntelliJ IDEA, it is \\n recommended to try `gradlew jar game`.\\n \\n This is all still subject to change in the coming days and weeks, so if you have any questions or suggestions, please\\n feel free to give them on [the forums] or the [Discord server].\\n\\n\x3c!-- References --\x3e\\n[IDEA 2020.1]: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows\\n[engine repository]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology\\n[downloading from GitHub]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/archive/develop.zip\\n[fetching with git]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology.git\\n[the forums]: http://forum.terasology.org/forum/\\n[Discord server]: https://discord.gg/terasology"},{"path":"/blog/gsoc-2020-halftime","tags":["GSoC"],"posttype":"blog","cover":{"publicURL":"/ModuleSite/static/5277af69ed324c1c93e2689d942cb854/cover.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#7898a8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/ModuleSite/static/5277af69ed324c1c93e2689d942cb854/b4f39/cover.png","srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/5277af69ed324c1c93e2689d942cb854/42a0c/cover.png 480w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/5277af69ed324c1c93e2689d942cb854/f0835/cover.png 960w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/5277af69ed324c1c93e2689d942cb854/b4f39/cover.png 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/5277af69ed324c1c93e2689d942cb854/6796c/cover.webp 480w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/5277af69ed324c1c93e2689d942cb854/f47ea/cover.webp 960w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/5277af69ed324c1c93e2689d942cb854/90e6e/cover.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"}]},"width":1920,"height":1055}}},"title":"GSOC 2020 - Halftime","author":"Niruandaleth & Skaldarnar","excerpt":"In our 5th year participating in the Google Summer of Code (GSOC), we welcomed six students to our community that joined efforts with…","date":"2020-07-19","description":"Students are mid-way through Google Summer of Code 2020 🎉  A lot of progress already visible.

Futhermore, wells are now no longer a infinite resource, but can dry out.\\n\\n![Empty and Full Well](mr-wells.png)\\n\\nTo improve the chances of the player surviving this rough place called the old west, the cities now include small patches of farming ground with fruit and vegetables growing on them.\\nThese fruit and vegetables can fill (depending on the sort) either hunger, or thirst, or both.\\n\\n![Farms](mr-farms.png)\\n\\nAfter dealing with the player\'s needs, the non-player characters got a tad more personality with their randomized names and different sizes.\\nAnd to enable even more players to fall in love with these gooey creatures, Andy is currently working on fixing a bunch of multiplayer issues 🛠\\n\\n\\n\\n# Biome-specific Content Enhancements for Terasology\\n## - by _ktksan_\\n\\n👉 [Progress Report (forum.terasology.org)](https://forum.terasology.org/threads/biome-specific-content-weekly-updates.2322/)\\n\\nBiome-specific content enhancements are impacts of a biome\'s characteristics on the player, which ktksan started out introducing by adding various effects that extreme climate like snow and desert can have on the player.\\nBy following Terasology\'s \\"Event-Component-System\\" (ECS) approach, they introduced new Hypothermia and Hyperthermia components the play will get in extreme climate conditions.\\nThese components negatively affect the player, for instance by slowing, hurting or weakening them.\\nA very nice visible effect that was added as well, was a \\"visible breathing\\" particle effect in cold areas:\\n\\n\\n<img src=\\"biome-effects_breath.gif\\" alt=\\"Visible Breath Effect\\" style=\\"height:300px\\">\\n\\n\\nOn they went with adding a \\"Body Temperature System\\" that reacts on climate information such as ambient temperature and in case of it growing very high or low can result in the player becoming hypo- or hyperthermic.\\nAs this is a rather complex topic, that required a lot of discussion, brainstorming and review cycles, it is not fully complete yet (!).\\nIn the meantime of all that communicative effort, ktksan continued to make progess on their project by adding materials that are dropped and can be used for crafting also newly added equipment that helps the player in extreme climatic situations.\\nTo only name a few examples for such items: Sand slippers to avoid heat burn and slowdown when moving through hot, loose sand or a woolen vest that warms the player in cold areas.\\n\\nAlong the way, ktksan also found, fixed or implemented several related, but theoretically out-of-scope issues and showed their motivation to contribute to Terasology beyond their project\'s scope.\\nOne good example for these efforts is adding a filling bar to fluid containers to improve the user experience when working with different fluid levels:\\n\\n![Filling Bar for Fluid Containers](biome-effects_fluid-filling-bar.png)\\n\\n\\n# Genome Expansion\\n## - by _Vedant Shroff_\\n\\n👉 [Progress Report (forum.terasology.org)](https://forum.terasology.org/threads/genome-expansion-project-weekly-updates.2323/)\\n\\nThe \\"Genome Expansion\\" project is a top-secret research project about module merging, plant breeding and nutrition research.\\nVedant\'s initial experiments showed that breeding algorithms can now be registered in \\"Genomes\\" with _traits_ 👨‍🔬.\\nBase algorithms for continuous and discrete traits were added and are ready to be used.\\n\\nThe next series of experiments proved the theory behind scientifically changing the color of items - also known as tinting.\\nNo players, animals or fruit were harmed in the process.\\n\\n![Genomes - Item Tinting](genomes_item-tinting.jpg)\\n\\nBased on these preliminary studies and by integrating with the state of the art work of jellysnake et al. such as \\"EdibleFlora\\" and \\"SimpleFarming\\", for instance by adding events, the next stage of the project could commence.\\nIn their laboratory, Vedant secretly developed a process to breed seeds, so that the Terasology world would be allowed to enjoy such marvelous wonders as blue raspberries 🍓\\n\\nNaturally, these genetic alterations don\'t come for free: The conducted research showed, that the genetics of edibles (food and drink) now affect their impact.\\nThis and the other experiments called for a lot of unit testing in the process 🕵️‍♂️\\n\\n\\n# Terasology Game Hud, Graphics Improvement & Gameplay Guide\\n## - by _Stefania Mak_\\n\\n👉 [Progress Report (forum.terasology.org)](https://forum.terasology.org/threads/ui-ux-project-weekly-updates.2321/)\\n\\nStefania\'s project is all about improving the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) and bringing Terasology and its gameplays closer to a distinct identity and style.

This should narrow\\ndown what the user reads and covers from the game documentation, what modules to look at, and what features of the engine to start with. \\nThis should make the game more approachable to individuals that want to contribute to the project. \\n\\nPratham initially started mocking up the layout of the site and working out the features that would be appropriate to the site. The final\\nstack was built in React and a JSON config file is used at the moment to setup the navigation of questions displayed on the site. There\\nhas been some cross talk between Stefania and Pratham on UI/UX and small improvements here and there such as adding additional padding. \\nPratham at the moment has been working on improving the functionality of the site.

You may think that we all took some break after GSOC finished, but quite the contrary seems to be the case.\\nSince the release of [Engine 4.0.0 / Alpha 16 - GSOC 2020](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/releases/tag/v4.0.0) there were **more than 120** <a href=\\"https://github.com/search?q=org%3AMovingBlocks+type%3Apr+merged%3A2020-09-20..2020-11-19\\"> merged engine PRs </a> 🤓 and **more than 130** <a href=\\"https://github.com/search?q=org%3ATerasology+type%3Apr+merged%3A2020-09-20..2020-11-19\\"> merged module PRs </a> 👾.\\nThat\'s an average of >4 PRs merged each day! We\'ll try to sum up the major achievements below, but feel free to read through each and every commit message at your convenience 😋\\n\\nA lot of these changes happened \\"under the hood\\" which means that, except for the obligatory new bugs 🐛, you as a player won\'t notice much of this. \\n_@Michael P_ and _@Niruandaleth_ have been working on migrating our code base away from [TeraMath](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TeraMath) towards [JOML](https://joml-ci.github.io/JOML/), the Java OpenGL Math Library. We hope to reduce maintenance effort by using a thirdparty library here, as well as for potential performance improvements due to the best practices that come with using JOML.\\n\\n_@immortius_ proposed to switch to [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) for models and animations more than a year ago (see [MovingBlocks/Terasology#3785](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/3785)) and with the help of _@PAndaContron_, _@Qwertygiy_, and _@Michael P_ we eventually merged this to our main branch. Since then, _@Niruandaleth_ and _@casals_ have been working on the [glTF clean-up](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues/4156), adjusting and fixing all the old MD5 models and animations in the game. We actually have so many of those that we should definitely make better use of them 🧐 (and we already have some ideas on how to do that ...).\\n\\nFinally, we also made the step towards [LW**JGL**](https://www.lwjgl.org/) thanks to the effort and contributions of _@DarkWeird_. This was initially suggested in December 2015 (now I\'m feeling old ... 👴) by _@msteiger_ (see [MovingBlocks/Terasology#2099](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues/2099)) and just now became reality by [MovingBlocks/Terasology#3969](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/3969). As with the other changes, you can see that everything is working if you don\'t see any difference to how it was before...\\n\\n![Cute Monsters](cute-monsters.png)\\n\\nBut it\'s not all just nerdy changes and improvements. We used the motivation and excitement about the new model format to add [cute monsters](https://www.patreon.com/posts/39982825) (incl. a new custom sheep model) to the game. The models were created by [_@quaternius_](http://quaternius.com/), be sure to check out their [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/quaternius/posts) for latest news and support.\\nThese new models are (partially) integrated with the [WildAnimals](https://github.com/Terasology/WildAnimals) module and replace the old low-poly models (like our good ol\' deer). We hope you like this new look, and we are looking forward to integrate more mobs and monsters into the gameplay templates so that you can experience them in the game!\\n\\nIn a similar fashion, [MetalRenegades](https://github.com/Terasology/MetalRenegades) is now way more ... metal 🤘 We replaced some of the Gooey citizens with actual robot models. Representing the good and lawful, sheriff robots will help to keep the piece in the old west towns. Opposing, the bad robots with their bulky, barrell-like bodies bend the boundaries of decency. Which side do you chose?\\n\\n![Metal Renegades Robots](metal-renegades-robots.png)\\n\\nAnd that\'s still not all! _@4D enthuasiast_ continues to shape the in-game world. By creating [FallingBlocks](https://github.com/Terasology/FallingBlocks) and reworking [FlowingLiquids](https://github.com/Terasology/FlowingLiquids) the world now feels more dynamic than before.\\nWith the mass-preserving system of flowing liquids water becomes a valuable resource that should be used with care. \\nWhole bodies of water may vanish in the depth of caves, so be careful which block you break!\\n\\n<div style=\\"display:flex;justify-content:center;\\">\\n<iframe style=\\"width:560px;height:315px\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CQHqrmoUWxQ\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen=\\"allowfullscreen\\"></iframe>\\n</div>\\n"},{"path":"/blog/tera-saturday-6-hide-and-sheep","tags":["TeraSaturday"],"posttype":"blog","cover":{"publicURL":"/ModuleSite/static/950ac9f6089ba06721ffeeafb7be80a3/cover.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/ModuleSite/static/950ac9f6089ba06721ffeeafb7be80a3/87706/cover.png","srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/950ac9f6089ba06721ffeeafb7be80a3/f80f8/cover.png 320w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/950ac9f6089ba06721ffeeafb7be80a3/9a63f/cover.png 640w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/950ac9f6089ba06721ffeeafb7be80a3/87706/cover.png 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/950ac9f6089ba06721ffeeafb7be80a3/c0bcc/cover.webp 320w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/950ac9f6089ba06721ffeeafb7be80a3/17574/cover.webp 640w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/950ac9f6089ba06721ffeeafb7be80a3/71d4d/cover.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":720}}},"title":"TeraSaturday #6: Hide and Sheep","author":"Skaldarnar","excerpt":"Welcome to the return of TeraSaturday, a not-so-weekly update post about all the neat stuff that has been going on in\\nthe world of…","date":"2020-11-28","description":"An exploration of recent events in Terasology development.","imageTag":null,"customLogo":null,"postNumber":null,"position":null,"mainImage":null,"content":"\\n_Welcome to the return of TeraSaturday, a not-so-weekly update post about all the neat stuff that has been going on in\\nthe world of Terasology! Half blog, half changelog, completely cool._\\n\\n## 📰 Since last TeraSaturday ...\\n\\nWe had the **November Play Test** last Sunday, trying out all the new and exciting things that have been added over the last months. We all tested the first release candidate for the upcoming stable version to identify weak spots we want to smooth out. You can download [Engine 4.1.0 / Alpha 17 Preview (Release Candidate 1)](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/releases/tag/v4.1.0-rc.1) as **Terasology (Nightly) #1119** in the launcher. _@Skaldarnar_ streamed via [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/terasology), you can watch the (slightly trimmed) recording below - as always, feedback is welcome 🤓\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QbD8Z98Evb4\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\nWe would like to say a warm \\"welcome 👋\\" to _@HajdaM_ and warm \\"welcome back 👋\\" to _@iHDeveloper_ who both jumped straight from play-testing into coding, e.g., by improving performance or the integration with Discord. _@Michael P_ and _@Niruandaleth_ are still crawling through the JOML conversion 👩‍🏫 and _@DarkWeird_, among other things, disassembles our engine into smaller subsystems 👨‍🔧\\n\\nOverall, we again merged more than **60 PRs** on [the engine](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AMovingBlocks+type%3Apr+merged%3A2020-11-20..2020-11-28) and in [module space](https://github.com/search?q=org%3ATerasology+type%3Apr+merged%3A2020-11-20..2020-11-28) over the last week, with more contributions from _@4D enthusiast_ and _@Cervator_. 💪\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n<img src=\\"discord-integration.jpg\\" alt=\\"Discord Integration\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\n## 🐛 Bug Fixes 🐞\\n\\n🕹 You may enjoy this play-test video by _Lowricsec_ who gave our May release a try. This has slipped our attention for 3 months, but here you go 🎮 Videos like these are a great source of both inspiration and new bugs to fix. It helps us to identify the issues that really affect the player, and we often also get some suggestions on how this might be fixed.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R3CozWpC3G0\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n_@Niruandaleth_ and _@Skaldarnar_ took this as an opportunity to address some of those bugs. They tweaked the brightness at night, adjusted the player height and model scale, pushed the name tags back into place, and got rid of some bugs which crashed the game. Health regeneration was also fixed, so no more blocks regaining their health faster than you can hit \'em. _@DarkWeird_ also contributed here, investigating some networking issues to make the \\"Join Game\\" work smoothly again.\\n\\n![Brightness at Night](./night-brightness.png)\\n\\n## 🚀 Module/Feature Highlights\\n\\nFinally, we want to give you a little sneak peak at the world generation improvements _@4D enthusiast_ is working on. On the long way to bringing back pretty overhangs you can now find overgrown cave entrances in the world (with the Caves world generator plugin). There are more improvements to lakes and surfaces in general, but this deserves it\'s own highlight spot 😉\\n\\n![Cave Entrace](./cave-entrance.jpg)\\n"},{"path":"/blog/tera-saturday-7-its-a-new-spawn-its-a-new-day","tags":["TeraSaturday"],"posttype":"blog","cover":{"publicURL":"/ModuleSite/static/ea7f645d4cce09d183292a26708f77df/cover.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/ModuleSite/static/ea7f645d4cce09d183292a26708f77df/4a49b/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/ea7f645d4cce09d183292a26708f77df/b4dad/cover.jpg 320w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/ea7f645d4cce09d183292a26708f77df/3440d/cover.jpg 640w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/ea7f645d4cce09d183292a26708f77df/4a49b/cover.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/ea7f645d4cce09d183292a26708f77df/c0bcc/cover.webp 320w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/ea7f645d4cce09d183292a26708f77df/17574/cover.webp 640w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/ea7f645d4cce09d183292a26708f77df/71d4d/cover.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":720}}},"title":"TeraSaturday #7: It\'s a new spawn, it\'s a new day","author":"Skaldarnar","excerpt":"Welcome to the return of TeraSaturday, a not-so-weekly update post about all the neat stuff that has been going on in\\nthe world of…","date":"2020-12-05","description":"An exploration of recent events in Terasology development.","imageTag":null,"customLogo":null,"postNumber":null,"position":null,"mainImage":null,"content":"\\n_Welcome to the return of TeraSaturday, a not-so-weekly update post about all the neat stuff that has been going on in\\nthe world of Terasology!

view and render distances**](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/4452) now!\\nThis was made possible by allowing for different levels of detail (LOD) for the chunks.\\nBut let\'s hear what _@4D Enthusiast_ has to say about this in detail. 🤓\\n\\n> I\'ve wanted to implement this feature for ages, but this has been the first time it was at the top of my priority list.\\n> I was a bit worried that it would make the code (particularly world generation) so much messier that it wouldn\'t be worth it, but now that I\'ve seen how great it looks, I\'m really pleased that I did do it.\\n\\n<div class=\\"row\\">\\n    <div class=\\"col mb-2 mt-2\\">\\n        <img  src=\\"./Terasology-210201222947-1920.jpg\\" alt=\\"Terasology-210201222947-1920\\">\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\\"col mb-2  mt-2\\">\\n        <img src=\\"./Terasology-210201223553-1920.jpg\\" alt=\\"Terasology-210201223553-1920\\">\\n    </div>\\n</div>\\n\\n> For each level of detail (with the number controlled by a slider, 1 to 10), a set of chunks is generated with half the resolution, but twice the size.\\n> There are also some LOD chunks around the edge of the actual loaded region that are about the same size as real chunks, in order to ensure that everything lines up neatly if the edge of the loaded region does not align to the double-scale chunk grid.\\n> This means that the amount of detail visible at each level of detail is approximately the same (because of perspective), but size of the visible area grows exponentially with the number of LOD levels.\\n> I set the maximum LOD level to 10 not because adding more would be too computationally expensive for anyone to run, but because the view area is already so large that levels 9 and 10 look practically identical anyway.\\n> As an example, with view distance Near (9 _ 7 _ 9), it would take 16 LODs to have an area the size of the earth visible, and 22 LODs for the moon to be directly visible in the sky (although a block-based moon couldn\'t actually move).\\n\\nSo, the available levels of details should be sufficient 👍\\nIn addition to scaling down the chunk resolution, the visible details are also limited to _world facets_ that support the scaling.\\nThis is currently only implemented for the basic terrain generation in _Core Gameplay_ and _Josharias Survival_, but we are looking forward to extending this to features like trees.\\nOh, and the LOD chunks should have a quite low impact on the performance, too:\\n\\n> After an LOD chunk is finished generating, all of its data except for the mesh is discarded, because they are static and cannot be interacted with, so the mesh is all that\'s needed.\\n> Because the mesh data is only stored on the GPU, this means that each LOD chunk takes up barely any main memory.\\n\\nAs always when writing some code, not everything went as planned right from the start.\\nRead on for some technical insights, as well as some more screenshots:\\n\\n> Unlike in normal chunk generation, each LOD chunk is generated completely independently of the others.\\n> This causes some issues in areas where the appearance of a chunk actually does depend on the adjacent chunks, in particular, lighting, ambient occlusion, and face culling.\\n> To approximate the lighting, the sunlight regen is set to full for any block at the top of a chunk that isn\'t too far underground, and that sunlight regen can pass through.\\n>\\n> In order to avoid issues with ambient occlusion and face culling, each LOD chunk is actually generated slightly larger than the area it needs to cover, so that there\'s overlap between the edges of adjacent chunks\' meshes.\\n> This also helps to cover up some of the gaps caused by differences between chunks of different scales.\\n> I also tried at one point having all the faces on the outside of each chunk visible in order to avoid gaps, but that made it much less efficient because of all of the underground chunks that would become visible.\\n\\n<div class=\\"row\\">\\n    <div class=\\"col mb-2\\">\\n        <img  src=\\"./Terasology-210201224636-1920.jpg\\" alt=\\"Terasology-210201224636-1920\\">\\n    </div>\\n    <div

clipping plane was sometimes too close.\\n> There\'s a trade-off in rendering between the accuracy with which it can be determined which of two things is closer (and therefore should be visible in front) and the maximum distance at which you can see something.\\n> The maximum distance was set to 5000 previously, I suppose as that seemed like obviously plenty (probably even too much), but with LOD chunks, much greater view distances than that are possible, so I had to adjust the far clipping plane distance to adapt to the current render distance and number of LODs.\\n> This then had another issue that at the minimum settings, the clipping plane was so close that the sky wasn\'t visible, and would just appear black instead, so I had to set a minimum limit to avoid that.\\n\\nWe are preparing a new release candidate to make this available from the launcher as well.\\nLooking forward to your feedback when checking this out! 🎮\\n\\n## 📰 Since last TeraSaturday ...\\n\\nThis spotlight post is mainly about the LOD chunks, but we don\'t want to withhold other news of the last week.\\n\\n_@keturn_ made a change to the workspace structure worth noting for developers: Gradle will no longer put jars in the `modules/` directory itself.\\nThere is a new directory `cachedModules` for the module JARs.\\nSee [MovingBlocks/Terasology#4454](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/4454) for more details.\\n\\n_@DarkWeird_ contributed a small change with great profit by [replacing dense arrays to sparse arrays for chunk\'s light data](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/4438).\\nThis benefits both LOD chunks and regular chunks as less memory is used during generation and while the chunks are loaded.\\nThis results in a performance boost of 5% for writing/reading.\\n\\nAnd, as always, JOML-ification was continued by _@Michael P_, _@Niruandaleth_, and _@Skaldarnar_ about to push it over the finish line today 🥳\\n\\nIn total we merged [~50 engine PRs](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AMovingBlocks+type%3Apr+merged%3A2021-01-30..2021-02-07+is%3Apr&type=issues) and [over 100

Half blog, half changelog, completely cool._\\n\\n## 📯 Terasology Alpha 19 (v4.3.0) released!\\n\\nWe are happy to announce that we just released [Terasology Alpha 19 (v4.3.0)].\\nWhile this release mainly consists of foundation work and \\"under-the-hood\\" improvements that are not visible in the game, our contributors also added a few quite visible goodies such as visual damage indicators (see [TeraSaturday #11]) and a world generation plugin for Flying Islands 🛸\\n\\n## 📰 Since last TeraSaturday ...\\n\\nMany thanks to our contributors since last [TeraSaturday #11]: _@antag99_, _@DarkWeird_, _@keturn_, _@pollend_, and _@skaldarnar_.\\n\\nAfter the preparational groundwork of the previous week, the _gestalt v7_ efforts of this week led to moving basically each and every package and file in the engine.\\nAs a result most of our Ωmega modules had to be adjusted accordingly.\\nA big thank you to _@keturn_, _@pollend_ and _@DarkWeird_ for their dedication! 🤗\\n\\n_@pollend_ and _@DarkWeird_ continued to brainstorm and discuss dependency injection (DI) for/with/in/through/by (🤪) gestalt.\\nWhile this is still in planning, we\'re looking forward to hear more about it soon™️ - so keep checking the TeraSaturday posts regularly 😉\\n\\nApart from his substantial contributions to the gestalt v7 efforts, _@keturn_ continued improving our test situation ([#4573](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/4573), [#4574](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/4574), [#4579](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/4579)) and started to investigate parallelization potential of our tests.\\nWhile he discovered that a parallel approach does indeed offer some speed-up, it was neither a quantum leap nor free of issues. Especially our ModuleTestingEnvironment (MTE) tests are troublesome as well as integration tests colliding on network ports, etc.\\nStill, we hope to be able to leverage parallelization especially for decoupled, dependency-less tests like unit tests in the future.\\n\\nLast but not least, we\'d like to send out a warm welcome and thank you to our new contributor _@antag99_ who made his debut in our community by fixing two recently introduced bugs 🎉\\nThe first bug he [fixed](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/4581) was likely introduced by our recent gestalt v7 preparations: after playing in a Terasology world, exiting to the main menu crashed the game.\\nThe second bug he [fixed](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/4585) was likely introduced by our recent JOML efforts: the target indication box on a previously targeted block to stayed rendered even when rotating the camera upwards so that it points at a block that is not within range.\\n\\nIn total, we merged [10 engine PRs](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AMovingBlocks+type%3Apr+merged%3A2021-03-14..2021-03-20) and [130 PRs on modules](https://github.com/search?q=org%3ATerasology+type%3Apr+merged%3A2021-03-14..2021-03-20).\\n\\n## 🎀️ Community Highlights\\n\\n### 🔮 Laputa Adamant\\n\\nWe start this week\'s community highlights with the finishing touches to the [Flying Islands][terasology/flyingislands] module, which is in the just released **alpha 19** (engine v4.3.0).\\n_@sin3point14_ did a great job implementing a world gen plugin to add flying islands to the world.\\n\\nBut what power lets these islands float in the air (and prevent them from falling down from the sky in case [Falling Blocks][terasology/fallingblocks] is enabled)?\\nOn the tracks of _[Gulliver\'s Travels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laputa)_ we discover that there is a strange block at the core of each of the islands, shimmering of magic.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n<video width= \\"320\\" height=\\"240\\"  autoplay loop>\\n  <source src=\\"./laputa-adamant.webm\\" type=\\"video/webm\\">\\n</video>\\n</p>\\n\\n> Working on a new block texture for the `Laputa Adamant` block in Flying Islands was pretty fun.\\n> I used thecontrols opportunity to try out [aseprite] for the pixel art, and am pretty satsified with how intuitive the UX is.\\n> I tried to catch the magical essence of the block - it is floating for some non-obvious reason, there has to be magic involved!✨ - by giving it a cracked look, with a purple light shining from the core.\\n>\\n> After _@4Denthusiast_ pointed out that we support **animated block tiles** the frame-by-frame animation of aseprite came in pretty handy, and now we have a pulsating, magical block 🙃\\n>\\n> <div align=\\"right\\">\\n> -- <i>@skaldarnar</i>\\n> </div>\\n\\n  <div align=\\"center\\" class=\\"mb-4\\">\\n      <img src=\\"./laputa-adamant-aseprite.png\\" alt=\\"Working on Lapuata Adamant block texture in aseprite\\"/>\\n  </div>\\n\\n### ✔️ Writing Actionable Action Items\\n\\nWhat sounds like a trivial issue is actually something that\'s rarely done and far from simple - action items are results of tests, discussions, meetings and other efforts that are too often neglected.\\nLike taking notes in general, during a discussion, presentation, course or meeting noting down action items seems unnecessary.\\nWhy? Because in the moment the notes should be taken, everything seems perfectly clear and intuitive to the point of obviousness.\\nWhy bother writing down the obvious...\\n\\nFurthermore, not all action items you might be inclined to write down after all are actually feasible.\\nClosely related to the art of realistic goal planning, deriving well-sized and feasible action items and writing them down in a clear, structured and understandable manner requires practise and experience.\\nIf action items are too wide-scoped, they take a lot of effort and time to complete which negatively impacts the sense of achievement.\\nHowever, if they are too small and manifold, they can seem tedious and boring and create a sense of being taken for a fool.\\nFurther, if action items are not feasible, they will lie around and be ignored to the point that - once they become feasible - everybody will assume they\'re still not feasible and keep ignoring them.\\n\\nWe recently observed that instead of writing up actionable action items as GitHub issues that are easy for everybody willing to contribute to find, we kept the action items in our org meeting document or as cards on our Trello boards.\\nBoth of them neither improve the visibility of the action items for new contributors, nor reduce maintainance efforts in terms of liaising potential contributions with the action item.\\n\\nThat\'s why, _@pollend_ started an effort to write up GitHub issues based on action items listed in our org meeting document and Trello boards.\\nIn a first step, this mainly targeted improvements for \\"Josharias Survival\\" one of our main gameplays.\\nYou can find the newly created and actionable items in the [associated \\"JoshariasSurvival\\" repository](https://github.com/Terasology/JoshariasSurvival/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).\\nWe hope that these enable interested contributors to get started with contributing gameplay improvements for Terasology.\\n\\n### 📚 Documentation Cleanup\\n\\nSpring is around the corner, as are all the GSOC students eager to dive deeper into the Terasology code base, so we put some effort into cleaning up the [Terasology Wiki].\\nIt all started off with a simple architectural overview of the typical **Terasology workspace** drawn by _@skaldarnar_.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img src=\\"./terasology-architecture.svg\\" alt=\\"Terasology high level architecture overview\\"/>\\n</div>\\n\\nAs you can see in the diagram, Terasology is build from many building bricks, that together turn into a game.\\nThe longer you work with the code, the more natural all this feels to you, but for somebody just scratching the surface this can be overwhelming at times.\\nSo, let\'s have a brief look at what the different parts are, and what they are used for.\\n\\nThe _engine_ forms the core, and resides alongside the default facade and subsystems in ([MovingBlocks/Terasology]).\\nFor instance, this inlcudes the core logic of the world generation framework, the `EntityManager` responsible for juggling all the entities, subsystem to handle networking or serialization - these kinds of things.\\nFacades are an abstraction to allow to use the game in different ways, e.g., a player typically uses the `PCFacade` for a \\"normal\\" gamepaly experience, a headless server runs without a graphical frontend, and we could also think of a lightweight 2D rendering layer for a web-based server atlas.\\n\\nThis core is backed by several in-house _libraries_, such as [MovingBlocks/gestalt] providing the entity system and module management, or our own UI library [MovingBlocks/TeraNUI].\\nYou typically don\'t interact too closely with them if you\'re working in module space, and even for working on the engine it\'s not required to have these libraries checked out.\\nHowever, it\'s more than likely that you\'ll encounter the one or other bug in here - contributions for fixin those are always welcome. 💚\\n\\nThe actual game content is added by _modules_ on top of that.\\nTerasology modules reside in the [Terasology Github organization] and are automatically covered by our CI pipeline.\\nAll the game\'s assets and pretty much all of the logic resides here - from Health and Inventory over world gen modules to advanced ItemPipes or FlowingLiquid simulations, you can find that in modules.\\n_Gameplay templates_ stitch a bunch of modules together to give the player an easy start with a pre-selected module lineup.\\n\\nIf you want to learn more, check out the [Terasology Wiki].\\nSpecial thanks to _@casals_ and _@Niruandaleth_ for helping with cleaning things up.\\n\\n---\\n\\nLet\'s end this post with a teaser for a TeraSpotlight post about our recent community pulse-check workshop that will (hopefully) come up soon™️: Have you ever thought about what animal Terasology might be? - We neither 😁 But then we decided to try... here\'s what we came up with ... 🥚 🐑 🐮 🐽\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n<img src=\\"./terasology-animal.png\\" alt=\\"What animal should Terasology become?\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n\x3c!-- References --\x3e\\n\\n[terasology alpha 19 (v4.3.0)]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/releases/tag/v4.3.0\\n[aseprite]: https://www.aseprite.org/\\n[terasology/flyingislands]: https://github.com/Terasology/FlyingIslands\\n[terasology/fallingblocks]: https://github.com/Terasology/FallingBlocks\\n[terasology wiki]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki\\n[movingblocks/terasology]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology\\n[movingblocks/gestalt]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/gestalt\\n[movingblocks/teranui]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TeraNUI\\n[terasology github organization]: https://github.com/Terasology\\n[terasaturday #11]: https://terasology.org/ModuleSite/blog/2021-03-13-terasaturday-11-gsoc-2021-is-coming\\n"},{"path":"/blog/tera-saturday-13-may-the-maven-be-with-us","tags":["TeraSaturday"],"posttype":"blog","cover":{"publicURL":"/ModuleSite/static/42a10781bb9e224a2a7a1abe789db834/cover.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#081828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/ModuleSite/static/42a10781bb9e224a2a7a1abe789db834/a764f/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/42a10781bb9e224a2a7a1abe789db834/fb67e/cover.jpg 480w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/42a10781bb9e224a2a7a1abe789db834/3059d/cover.jpg 960w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/42a10781bb9e224a2a7a1abe789db834/a764f/cover.jpg 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/42a10781bb9e224a2a7a1abe789db834/3a3a2/cover.webp 480w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/42a10781bb9e224a2a7a1abe789db834/bde8a/cover.webp 960w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/42a10781bb9e224a2a7a1abe789db834/c512e/cover.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"}]},"width":1920,"height":1080}}},"title":"TeraSaturday #13: May the Maven be with us","author":"Niruandaleth","excerpt":"Welcome to the return of TeraSaturday, a not-so-weekly update post about all the neat stuff that has been going on in\\nthe world of…","date":"2021-04-17","description":"An exploration of recent events in Terasology development.","imageTag":null,"customLogo":null,"postNumber":null,"position":null,"mainImage":null,"content":"\\n_Welcome to the return of TeraSaturday, a not-so-weekly update post about all the neat stuff that has been going on in\\nthe world of Terasology! Half blog, half changelog, completely cool._\\n\\n## 📩 GSoC Student Applications arrived!\\n\\nOver the past weeks, almost 30 students joined our Discord Server, introducing themselves and voicing interest in Google\'s Summer of Code (GSoC).\\nWith a round dozen of these students we enjoyed a lot of Q&A, discussion rounds and draft proposal review back-and-forth - basically setting our Discord on fire 🔥\\nWe\'re proud to announce that we received 14 student applications for projects within our community in the context of this year\'s GSoC 💚\\n\\n## 📰 Since last TeraSaturday ...\\n\\nMany thanks to our contributors since last [TeraSaturday #12]: _@4Denthusiast_, _@ahv15_, _@antag99_, _@APsenpai42_, _@BenjaminAmos_, _@DarkWeird_, _@jdrueckert_, _@keturn_, _@mahela97_, _@pollend_, _@ryuk156_, _@skaldarnar_, _@tolziplohu_ 👏\\n\\nFirst of all, we doubled up on UI this week 🖥️🖥️ when updating from `TeraNUI` 1.5 to 3.0! You could also say, our user interface got 3D now, but maybe that\'s too much bad jokes for one blog post 🤪\\nWhile talking about UI, let\'s also mention that _@DarkWeird_ [migrated `PlayerConfig` to leverage `AutoConfig`](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/4599).\\n\\nWith our documentation efforts focusing on making it easier for module developers to adjust documentation as part of a PR, we also continuously try to make it easier for our contributors to write blog posts.\\nIn this context, _@skaldarnar_ fixed the devcontainer setup for our website, such that in addition to using GitPod, blog posts can also be authored using the [Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).\\n\\nAmongst all those nice tooling improvements, sometimes we also have to say goodbye to some tools:\\nThis time we\'re [seeing `JCenter` off into the sunset](https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/) by [removing it from all our build configurations](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues/4582).\\nSo the tool is dead, long live the tool! - And may the maven be always in our favor ✊\\n\\nIn other news, _@4Denthusiast_ conducted an [extensive refactoring of chunk-related classes](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/4600) affecting pretty much every module with world-generation aspects.\\nFurthermore, _@DarkWeird_, _@pollend_ and _@BenjaminAmos_ continued to work on [dependency injection (DI) for `gestalt`](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/gestalt/pull/87). Hopefully, later this weekend, we\'ll see a new `gestalt` release that includes the changes, allowing `TeraNUI` and `DestinationSol` to consume them.\\n\\nWith a [change to our `gradle` setup](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/4611), it\'s now possible to run the speedy unit tests and the rather slow and sometimes shaky integration tests (using `ModuleTestingEnvironment` or `TerasologyTestingEnvironment`) separately locally. As part of the preparation work for that, integration tests got an `MteTest` or `TteTest` tag to allow filtering for them. In addition, failing tests in [`SimpleFarming`](https://github.com/Terasology/SimpleFarming/pull/114) and [`Pathfinding`](https://github.com/Terasology/Pathfinding/pull/59) were fixed, while others were [removed](https://github.com/Terasology/Behaviors/pull/73) or [disabled](https://github.com/Terasology/DynamicCities/pull/97).\\nIdeally, both, unit and integration tests should succeed and be reliable, however as we\'ve seen integration tests fail sporadically, for instance due to race conditions or timeouts, the trust in them is somewhat limited.\\nThe separation allows PR authors to differentiate a failure in the trustworthy unit test, indicating that their PR broke something, from a failure in the less trustworthy integration tests.\\nWe encourage everybody to investigate any failure regardless of its origin, but in urgent cases, an integration test failure might be accepted to get a fix in in time, for instance for a playtest or release candidate.\\nPlease note, that the integration of this separation into the CI is still work in progress - we\'ll keep you posted 📯\\n\\nLast but not least, we\'d like to send out a warm welcome and thank you to our new contributors and GSoC applicants _@tolziplohu_ and _@mahela97_ who made their debuts in our community by [fixing a bug allowing to place blocks inside the player](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/4608) and [allowing players to keep jumping](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/pull/4609/files) 🦘\\nFurthermore, there were some gameplay improvements with _@ahv15_ [randomizing the player respawn location](https://github.com/Terasology/LightAndShadow/pull/197) in `LightAndShadow` and first-time contributor _@APsenpai_ improving the user experience in `JoshariasSurvival` by [increasing thirst replenishment when drinking with a `woodenCup`](https://github.com/Terasology/ManualLabor/pull/46).\\n\\nIn total, we merged [34 engine PRs](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AMovingBlocks+type%3Apr+merged%3A2021-03-21..2021-04-17&type=Issues) and [58 PRs on modules](https://github.com/search?q=org%3ATerasology+type%3Apr+merged%3A2021-03-21..2021-04-17&type=Issues).\\n\\n## 🎀️ Community Highlights\\n\\n### ✨ Prettifying Repositories and Documentation\\n\\nAfter cleaning up our main documentation in the engine wiki, we\'re continuing the documentation efforts outside of the engine.\\nUntil we have enough capacity to introduce some more complex tool like [OrchidDocs](https://orchid.run/bundles/orchiddocs), we\'ll leverage the light and less intrusive [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/).\\nHave a look at the fancy new docs of our first migration candidate [`Health`](https://github.com/Terasology/Health): https://terasology.github.io/Health ✨\\n\\nWhile in the artistic zone due to creating neat module banner images, _@skaldarnar_ also for our [module/repository archive](https://github.com/Terasology-Archived/).\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img src=\\"./terasology-archived-logo.png\\" alt=\\"Visualizations in Kibana based on Log Data\\" width=\\"50%\\"/>\\n</div>\\n\\n### ✒️ Breaking Down Proposals and Feature Tasks\\n\\n_@keturn_ wrote an [incredibly awesome forum post](https://forum.terasology.org/threads/proposals-and-feature-task-breakdown.2345/) as guidance for our prospective students regarding considerations for project time management and planning.\\nThis post includes all the nitty-gritty details that you are likely to not consider when you\'re entering the complex world of software development and projects.\\n\\nTo only mention a few examples: collecting stakeholder feedback when designing software, doing proper research including state of the art work in- and outside of a project, planning with a bunch of iteration cycles, and collaborating with others by reviewing, answering questions or acting as a stakeholder yourself.\\n\\n### 📊 Kibana Dashboard\\n\\nGSoC applicant _@Pushpesh_ started playing around with visualizations in Kibana based on log data we collect on a voluntary basis.\\nThe student applied for a project targeting log data analysis to help us gain information about the adoption of our gameplays and modules as well as about frequent issues and instable modules.\\nWith DPP and GDPR, there\'s two more big topics to work out before we can move to a consent-based default log collection.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img src=\\"./kibana-dashboard.png\\" alt=\\"Visualizations in Kibana based on Log Data\\" width=\\"100%\\"/>\\n</div>\\n\\n\x3c!-- References --\x3e\\n\\n[terasaturday #12]: https://terasology.org/ModuleSite/blog/2021-03-20-terasaturday-12-whatever-floats-your-island\\n"},{"path":"/blog/tera-spotlight-contributor-pulse-check","tags":["TeraSpotlight"],"posttype":"blog","cover":{"publicURL":"/ModuleSite/static/ca1d1a98609d1131deb03fc6116f4432/cover.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/ModuleSite/static/ca1d1a98609d1131deb03fc6116f4432/a764f/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/ca1d1a98609d1131deb03fc6116f4432/fb67e/cover.jpg 480w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/ca1d1a98609d1131deb03fc6116f4432/3059d/cover.jpg 960w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/ca1d1a98609d1131deb03fc6116f4432/a764f/cover.jpg 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/ca1d1a98609d1131deb03fc6116f4432/3a3a2/cover.webp 480w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/ca1d1a98609d1131deb03fc6116f4432/bde8a/cover.webp 960w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/ca1d1a98609d1131deb03fc6116f4432/c512e/cover.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"}]},"width":1920,"height":1080}}},"title":"TeraSpotlight: Contributor Pulse Check","author":"Niruandaleth","excerpt":"Please enjoy this special spotlight post about results of a workshop we are excited about.

We hope you will like it as much as we do!_\\n\\nA few weeks ago we had ourselves our first community workshop.\\nThis workshop was intended to perform a pulse check on us as individual contributors and us as a community.\\nWith seven people in total, this was a small enough group to allow us to focus on everyone\'s thoughts yet with the most active contributors present a very representative group for our community.\\n\\n## 🗒️ Workshop Format\\n\\nBefore we dive in, a quick shout-out to [Mural](https://www.mural.co/), an awesome tool allowing for very simple collaborative brainstorming for various purposes.\\nWe\'re happy to have been accepted for their free nonprofit plan and had a very good time using Mural for our workshop.\\n\\nEvery workshop needs some ground rules to allow for a productive session enabling everybody to participate and bring in their ideas and thoughts.\\nA basic set of ground rules was given as a start, encouraging everybody to speak up to ask questions or request a break as well as to avoid finger-pointing and technical discussions.\\nBased on this, the first part of our workshop concentrated on developing code of conduct for the workshop that we all feel comfortable with and agree on, by asking ourselves, what we expect to make this a \\"meaningful & pleasant workshop\\"\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img src=\\"./workshop-code-of-conduct.png\\" alt=\\"Workshop Code of Conduct\\" width=\\"50%\\"/>\\n</div>\\n\\nThe responses made it pretty clear, that we wanted this workshop to be fun, but still talk very honestly and openly about what we value and want for Terasology.\\nReflecting how we interact with each other in our community, another big focus point was fairness.\\nIt showed that everybody\'s opinion is important to us and we want to give everybody an equal chance to bring in their ideas.\\nOn a similar note, it showed that we value honesty and openness while practicing mutual respect in terms of communication and focus.\\n\\nWith this code of conduct in place, it was time to talk agenda.\\nThe workshop was prepared to allow covering three modules: motivation, vision and community.\\nWith the content-wise thoughts on what would make this a \\"meaningful workshop\\", it already became clear that our main area of interest was finding out what our individual goals and visions for Terasology are and see which overlap and which diverge.\\nThe planned workshop time allowed us to cover two of the three prepared modules and with \\"vision\\" being set, we decided to in addition talk about \\"motivation\\".\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img src=\\"./workshop-module-interest.png\\" alt=\\"Workshop Module Vote\\" width=\\"30%\\"/>\\n</div>\\n\\nWith these interactive conduct and agenda alignments done, both modules followed a very similar structure.\\nFor each module, we started with a fun little \\"spirit animal\\" icebreaker exercise asking everybody to post a picture of an animal describing how they view or feel about something 🐾\\nAfterwards, we had five different prompts to self-reflect on, aimed at being very honest to ourselves and explore our personal opinions and thoughts.\\nFor each of these prompts, everyone first got some \\"alone-time\\" to self-reflect and answer before we made all notes visible to everybody else.\\nThe second step for each of these prompts was then to read through everything, clarify anything that was unclear and try to cluster everything.\\nThe clustering allowed us to identify areas of overlap, showing what\'s important to us collectively, but also areas of divergence, showing individual motivations and visions.\\n\\n## 🔥 Motivation\\n\\nThis first workshop module was all about motivation:\\n\\n- what motivates us to work on an open source project?\\n- what made us join and stay with the Terasology community?\\n- what factors demotivate and motivate us when working on Terasology?\\n\\n### 🐾 Contributor Spirit Animals\\n\\nEach of us is an individual human being with different character, mindset, goals and dreams.\\nWe act and contribute in different ways and for different reasons.\\nThis is why, the first question we asked ourselves was: \\"Which animal do I feel like when contributing to Terasology?\\"\\n\\nFrom ant to elephant, from whale to platypus, from peacock to ant-eater - the spirit animals representing us contributing to Terasology were as different as we are as people.\\nWhile some of us run around all busy, working on a lot of different topics and areas, others prefer to contribute with large changes with long term goals.\\nSome even do both, being rather casual for a while and then bursting out in activity.\\nAt the same time, some of us like to produce fancy, visible features and show them off, while others concentrate on \\"eating\\" bugs or work behind the scenes to keep the community going.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img src=\\"./contributor-spirit-animals.png\\" alt=\\"Which animal do I feel like when contributing to Terasology?\\" width=\\"50%\\"/>\\n</div>\\n\\n### 🔍 Project Requirements\\n\\nMost of us already contribute to open source projects for several years and learned what we like in a project and what we don\'t.\\nIn this light, we self-reflected on the following prompt: \\"If I\'d start Open Source contribution now, I\'d look for a project, that ...\\"\\n\\nAfter writing down whatever came to mind, we found a hand full of clusters that sum up our thoughts pretty nicely:\\n\\n- **User Focus** - we value both, an existing user base and that we ourselves use what we work on\\n- **Community** - a welcoming, open, active and knowledgeable community is as important to us as good organization and a low entry-barrier\\n- **Potential** - it\'s important to us that we see the potential for growth and adoption by users\\n- **Match to Interests** - we actually like it when topics, tools and technology we deal with at work and in our free time blend well and we can use the resulting synergies to improve and become more experienced\\n- **Nerdiness** - we\'re drawn to interesting yet quality-improving tools and languages and technical challenges that give us the opportunity to grow\\n\\n### 💚 Terasology and Us\\n\\nAll these thoughts about what we would look for in a project if we\'d start contributing to open source now, brings up the question of whether that\'s also reflected in why we joined Terasology.\\nSo it was time to revisit what motivated us to join Terasology and the paths that led us here in the first place.\\nFurther, we reflected on our relationship to Terasology - what Terasology as a project currently is to us and what keeps us bound to it.\\n\\nThe responses to the \\"I joined Terasology to ...\\" varied quite a bit, but still we were able to find a few patterns in our clustering activity.\\nWhile most of us participated in GSoC and stumbled upon Terasology in the process of looking for a suitable project to contribute to, others learned about it in different ways or, in the case of Cervator our project lead, were around from the very start.\\nThe clusters of the previous reflection also showed up again here - many of us joined for any or multiple of the following reasons:\\n\\n- to help realize the project\'s potential of becoming a game we ourselves (would like to) play 🕹️\\n- to enable others to build on it, create an alternative to Minecraft or just \\"have a frame to paint in\\" 🎨\\n- to learn and improve our skills 🎓\\n- to meet people with similar interest 👨‍💻👩‍💻\\n- to work on something we\'re interested in 🤓\\n\\nMost of these are nostalgic memories on the positive intentions and expectations that led us to join Terasology.\\nSo next it was time to be honest to ourselves and enter the present time and with it our current feelings towards our project.\\nThe thoughts triggered by the \\"Terasology currently is to me ...\\" prompt showed a lot of love and heartfelt bond with Terasology, but also brought up a first taste of what we\'re unhappy with and what concerns us:\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n    \\"Terasology is a <b>tech playground</b>\\"\\n</div>\\n\\nTerasology is a place to learn and grow.\\nIt offers a lot of different areas to \\"self-actualize\\", to experiment, improve and grow as a coder, as a software developer, as a person.\\nIt also impressively highlights the intricacies of Java and Gradle and poses interesting programming problems and space for architectural discussions and design.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n\\"Terasology is a <b>tech demo</b>\\"\\n</div>\\n\\nAll these different areas for self-actualization and experimenting and our ambition to make everybody happy took their toll on Terasology\'s \\"state\\".\\nWe are struggling and are in search of both an identity and a player base.\\nFrankly put, our codebase is quite broken and more a proof of concept than an actual game.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n\\"Terasology is <b>our drive & ambition</b>\\"\\n</div>\\n\\nIn the midst of all these challenges, the important thing is that we\'re still willing to continue working on it.\\nWe are aware of the state of our codebase, but we still see the potential, we see what it could become one day.\\nSo we continue to put in the work, fix bugs, improve architecture, documentation and code and try to motivate more people to join the effort.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n\\"Terasology is <b>our brand</b>\\"\\n</div>\\n\\nWhy do we even bother, you ask? Because we love Terasology.\\nEspecially in the current \\"scary world of 2020/2021\\", Terasology for us is an anchor of stability, a refuge to code in and a hiding place from all the real-world mess.\\nFor us, it\'s our main non-work activity and a regular part of our weekly focus time off the clock.\\nWe consider ourselves a community of friends and deeply care for our project.\\n\\n### 🔥 \\"Yay\\"s & \\"Ney\\"s 🧯\\n\\nAlbeit all the love and care, naturally there are factors that demotivate us and slow down our drive.\\nThe responses to the \\"When contributing to Terasology, I\'m demotivated by/when ...\\" prompt brought to light both technical and non-technical factors:\\n\\n- **Review Load** - efforts often stall due to PRs sitting around unmerged because nobody reviews them - and the few people that do review often don\'t find time for anything else\\n- **Lack of Focus** - our recent attempts to channel and streamline our efforts to finish more complex stabilization topics one by one instead of starting multiple ones in parallel that conflict or compete for resources are somewhat successful but we still have a long way to go\\n- **Complexity** - the sheer size of our codebase requires constant upkeep and makes it hard to troubleshoot and understand yet easy to break things by accident\\n- **Lack of Usability & Adoption** - being more of a tech demo and less of a game, Terasology lacks usability which results in low attention from players\\n- **(Inter-)Personal Issues** - as an open and international community, there\'s always potential for personal conflicts due to poor wording or language barriers, cultural differences as well as differing opinions\\n- **Lack of Time** - irrespective of student, employed or parent, all of us would love to have more time to spend on Terasology\\n\\nFortunately, there are many aspects that counter these demotivating issues and motivate us time and again to stick with the project and keep it going.\\nIn response to the \\"When contributing to Terasology, I\'m motivated by/when ...\\" prompt, we collected the following factors that boost our motivation:\\n\\n- ✨ **Technology** - we love it to share interesting things, play around with new tools and tech and find a shiny new use for some piece of logic that\'s been around a while\\n- 💪 **Achievements** - getting things done, solving problems, finally fixing \\"that bug\\" - improving and seeing how much we achieved recently is a big motivator for us\\n- 🧐 **Responsibility** - we don\'t like to point fingers, but we share the feeling that it\'s our responsibility to fix a bug we feel is our fault and this drives us both to investigate and fix it and to test our contributions even more thoroughly the next time\\n- 🤝 **Activity & Collaboration** - we are motivated by working together as a team and more people joining our cause allowing for even more progress and achievements\\n- 🤗 **Appreciation** - visibility outside of our community in posts and videos as well as inside of it when people enthusiastically share what they\'ve worked on or that they tried something and it worked out nicely - this really makes us all smiles 😊\\n- 🚀 **Vision** - sharing the crazy dreamland ideas we have and getting everybody excited about what Terasology could become keeps up the spirit and belief in our cause\\n\\n## 🔮 Vision\\n\\nFully motivated by the first module, in this second workshop module we set out to try to understand what our vision for Terasology is:\\n\\n- how do we (want to) stand out?\\n- what would we like to change and work on?\\n- how do we feel about Terasology\'s future?\\n- who do we want Terasology to be built for?\\n\\n### 🐾 Terasology Spirit Animal\\n\\nBased on all the different areas of Terasology we work on, we see Terasology from different perspectives.\\nBased on all the different dreams, wishes and ideas we have for Terasology, we see it in a different light.\\nSo the first question we asked ourselves in the context of our vision for Terasology was: \\"Which animal describes what you would like Terasology to become?\\"\\n\\nFrom butterfly to dragon, from bee to peacock, from owl-bear over spider-pig to egg-laying-wool-milk-sow, again the variety of spirit animals was creative and astounding.\\nThe most present associated attributes were an attractive and recognizable identity and a large diversity with many pieces that all are useful and work together to build a powerful entity.\\nFurther, maturity and the transition required to get there was an important topic, too.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img src=\\"./terasology-spirit-animals.png\\" alt=\\"Which animal describes what you would like Terasology to become?\\" width=\\"50%\\"/>\\n</div>\\n\\n### 💸 Selling Point\\n\\nWe don\'t want to be yet another Minecraft clone, we want to be Terasology. But what is it that sets Terasology apart?\\nThis is what we reflected on in the following prompt: \\"Terasology stands out from other voxel (engine) projects in that ...\\"\\nHere\'s what we see as our current \\"selling points\\":\\n\\n- **History** - Terasology is around for almost a decade now (that\'s longer than quite some start-up companies), so we definitely have long-time project and community management experience to show for 👔\\n- **Repository/Contributor Ratio** - mainly a tongue-in-cheek comment, we indeed have quite a number of repositories with currently unfortunately only a low number of very active contributors - resulting in a lot of space to self-actualize yourself 😜\\n- **Openness** - our community is both, very open to new collaborators and in general not strictly steered - everybody is free to work on what they like, although we are happy about any contributors that want to join our coordinated efforts 💪\\n- **Modding** - Terasology is highly focused on a modular (ECS-based) approach allowing to \\"make more out of it than just a voxel engine demo\\" 🤓\\n\\n### ✨ Genie in a Bottle\\n\\nHave you ever worked on something and wished you could just snap your finger and make something happen?\\nUs, too. So in response to the \\"If I could change one thing about Terasology with the snap of a finger, I\'d change ...\\" we came up with the following:\\n\\n- reduced complexity, both in terms of the amount of repositories and the amount of abstraction\\n- increased consistency, both in terms of documentation and visuals like menu theme, icon style or generally a full-fledged functional and powerful UI framework\\n- integrated infrastructure, both for testing and multi-repo builds and continuous integration\\n\\n### 💚 Personal Plans\\n\\nNext to all the upkeep we do, it\'s important for our vision to understand, what everybody would like to (be able to) work on.\\nThe responses to the \\"I would like to spend Terasology time on ...\\" again showed a lot of overlap:\\n\\n- **Architecture & Logistics** - we want to fix our codebase by improving architecture and concepts, document them and finish the backbone of automation that supports our build, test and release processes\\n- **UI & UX** - we want to work on finding our visual identity by taking time to work on design and assets, customize our UI and improve our user experience issues\\n- **Stability** - we want to fix bugs and get our codebase into a more stable and usable state\\n- **Dreamland Craziness** - everything from in-game automation to flying cars, we\'d love to implement more cool features and provide more end-user content\\n- **Community Activity** - we want to collaborate and explore new concepts and opportunities, chat and share what we work on, and first and foremost play our game together with our community more often\\n\\n### 🔮 Terasology\'s Future\\n\\nThe combination of personal plans and the awareness, that the current state may be far from being able to act on them, created a lot of different emotions when thinking about the future of Terasology.\\nBoth, hope and concerns were the tenor of the responses to the \\"When I think about Terasology\'s future, I ...\\" prompt.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n\\"I feel a <b>mix of excitement and dread</b>\\"\\n</div>\\n\\nThere\'s definitely a chance of us falling back into old patterns, getting less stable again or being stuck in the past due to not enough time to turn things around.\\nHowever, we do have a lot of potential and although likely being (expectedly) never truly finished, we will never run out of ideas on how to improve.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n\\"I hope that Terasology will be a <b>playable game with a strong identity</b>\\"\\n</div>\\n\\nIt already became obvious in the motivation module, but here it was again: We desperately want Terasology to become more than a tech demo and more than a Minecraft clone.\\nWe want it to be a game that\'s attractive to play, both for us as for people outside of our community - a game that we can spend hundreds of hours playing.\\nAnd we want it to have it\'s own recognizable identity to escape the stereotype of \\"yet another Minecraft clone\\".\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n\\"I hope that more people will enjoy Terasology as <b>a platform for their projects</b>\\"\\n</div>\\n\\nOne of the main reasons behind our very modular approach has always been the goal to enable others to build on Terasology.\\nWe want it to be a platform that can be adopted as the basis for new games and to generally \\"build nice things\\".\\n\\n### 🎯 Target Audience\\n\\nDuring this module on our vision for Terasology, we though a lot about what sets us apart, what we want to work on and change and what we see in our crystal balls when we look into Terasology\'s future.\\nAll of those and the target group for which we build Terasology are dependant on each other, which is why we tried to state our personal views on the \\"In my opinion the target group of Terasology should be ...\\" prompt.\\n\\n- **Learners** - no matter if student, developer, designer - anybody that is willing to find their footing in game development and want to embrace this in a free and open community is welcome\\n- **Modders** - 3rd party developers that want to implement their ideas and visions, change a voxel game to their liking, expand on their own projects or just want a (starting) place to experiment are welcome\\n- **Players** - we want to be a strong option for players looking for collaborative, creative and open-world voxel sandbox games\\n\\n## 💪 Follow-Ups\\n\\nThis workshop aimed at performing a pulse check on us as individual contributors as well as as a community and I personally believe, that it achieved that goal.\\nHowever, after working on the \\"motivation\\" and \\"vision\\" modules, we felt like something was missing.\\nThe nature of a pulse check is to collect a first set of information about the mood in a community and identify on a rather high level what\'s already working well and where there\'s room for improvement.\\nIn this workshop we collected this information and through the clustering already identified both working and problematic aspects of our community and contributing to our project.\\nHowever, this clustering is only an intermediate step and we need to go beyond this.\\n\\nOur first follow-up is this workshop summary, to broadcast our findings and encourage everybody to share their thoughts on it and join the cause.\\nA second follow-up will be documenting our shared \\"values\\" (irrespective of whether we already live by them or are working on getting there) we identified as well as our shared vision for Terasology.\\nThe third step will be drilling down on the high-level areas.\\nOn one hand, this includes the areas for improvement that we identified and agreed on, in order to leverage the momentum of interest and motivation to figure out what we can do to actually make a change there.\\nOn the other hand, this includes topics that we diverged on, in order to find a collaborative way to satisfy all our needs while also agreeing on at least a rough course to sail on and avoid pulling on different ends of the same rope.\\n\\nHere\'s a (non-exhaustive) list of examples for possible future workshop topics:\\n\\n- putting ourselves into the shoes of potential players\\n- putting ourselves into the shoes of potential modders & contributors\\n- retrospective on GSoC\\n- brainstorming on code style\\n"},{"path":"/blog/tera-saturday-14-spring-cleanup","tags":["TeraSaturday"],"posttype":"blog","cover":{"publicURL":"/ModuleSite/static/7eac981e748f7a1aa0304bd19463364d/cover.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/ModuleSite/static/7eac981e748f7a1aa0304bd19463364d/a764f/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/7eac981e748f7a1aa0304bd19463364d/fb67e/cover.jpg 480w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/7eac981e748f7a1aa0304bd19463364d/3059d/cover.jpg 960w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/7eac981e748f7a1aa0304bd19463364d/a764f/cover.jpg 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/7eac981e748f7a1aa0304bd19463364d/3a3a2/cover.webp 480w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/7eac981e748f7a1aa0304bd19463364d/bde8a/cover.webp 960w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/7eac981e748f7a1aa0304bd19463364d/c512e/cover.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"}]},"width":1920,"height":1080}}},"title":"TeraSaturday #14: Spring Cleanup","author":"Skaldarnar","excerpt":"Welcome to the return of TeraSaturday, a not-so-weekly update post about all the neat stuff that has been going on in\\nthe world of…","date":"2021-05-16","description":"An exploration of recent events in Terasology development.","imageTag":null,"customLogo":null,"postNumber":null,"position":null,"mainImage":null,"content":"\\n_Welcome to the return of TeraSaturday, a not-so-weekly update post about all the neat stuff that has been going on in\\nthe world of Terasology!

I even seem to get auto-redirected to it now.\\n\\nIn other logistical news, the old Jenkins is gone - which essentially led to the new launcher releases promoted above 🙈\\nUnfortunately, this also means that most old builds of Terasology are currently no longer available via the launcher.\\nBut don\'t worry: if you\'re getting nostalgic you can crawl through the [releases on

[Google Summer of Code]._\\n_We are happy to announce that we are supported by five students over the summer._\\n_The students will contribute to different areas of our wide ecosystem, ranging from modernizing our web presence over world generation both, in space and on earth, to improvements in various gameplays._\\n\\n## The Terasology Foundation Ecosystem\\n\\nTo give you a better overview where the projects are located in the broad ecosystem of the The Terasology Foundation we\'ve prepared this little diagram.\\nYou can click on the components to navigate to their respective Github repository.\\nBoth of our games, _Terasology_ and _Destination: Sol_ (get it [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/342980/Destination_Sol/)), albeit being quite different in their setting and aesthetics, share a common technical foundation.\\nYou may have heard about our in-house libraries _gestalt_ (module and asset management, entity component system) and _TeraNUI_ (UI framework) from previous TeraSaturday posts. 😉\\n\\n<style>\\n figcaption {\\n  font-size: 2rem;\\n  font-style: italic\\n }\\n</style>\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n <img class=\\"img-fluid\\" src=\\"2021-05-gsoc-projects.svg\\" alt=\\"gsoc_projects\\" />\\n <figcaption>The Terasology Foundation ecosystem and areas of contribution for the GSOC projects.</figcaption>\\n</div>\\n\\nThe games also share a similar internal structure, being split into the main `engine` and `modules` that can be used for ad-hoc extension.\\nTerasology already makes heavy use of the module concept, and recent GSOC projects aimed to bring this flexibility also to Destination: Sol.\\nBy modularizing the world generation of Destination: Sol, Isaiah will be working somewhere between the engine and module space.\\nIn a similar position we find Lorxu\'s project on world generation for Metal Renegades.\\nWhile the goal is to improve the world generation of a gameplay template, many of the world generation concepts are still defined in the engine or at the very roots of the module dependency tree.\\nWe\'ll see him jumping back and forth between these code locations over the summer.\\n\\nMeet and Alluri have a clearer assignment to module space.\\nBoth students will focus on gameplay improvements, cleaning up modules, and establishing best-practice implementations for new features with the entity component system.\\nThe two focus areas here are the modules around Light & Shadow (our capture the flag game mode) and Josharias\' Survival (well, you guessed it - our survival game mode).\\n\\nBeside the games we are developing, there are a couple of side projects worth mentioning.\\nThe launcher serves as the entry point to the world of Terasology for players, giving them a simple interface to download, update, and start their game.\\nIt is also built in Java, but otherwise shares little code with the main projects.\\n\\nFinally, our web presence is distributed over a couple of repositories.\\nThis includes this website and the linked adventure site to explore contribution paths.\\nWhile the good ol\' Jekyll-based page has served us well, the web technology whisperers have told us that the time has come for a modernization.\\nWe want to take this as an opportunity to make our vast module line-up more accessible to players.\\nYash will mostly focus on this new module site, but also has the task to migrate all the blog posts and other content from this website over to the new stack.\\n\\nRead on to learn more about the individual projects!\\n\\n<div

quality improvements for \\"Light & Shadow\\" in their GSoC project.\\nAs a first step, this includes overhauling the module in terms of package structure, code quality, bug fixes and documentation.\\n\\nSecond, they will bring together and extend on existing mechanisms for economy (`Economy`) and defensive mechanisms (`GooeyDefense`) to allow for a more immersive gameplay experience than the current race for the flag.\\nThis will also lay a basic foundation for future work on minion management in \\"Light & Shadow\\".\\n\\nFinally, Alluri will leverage the weapons and traps provided by `CombatSystem` to empower players to actively influence both their team and their opponents.\\nUsing similar effects like the `GooeyDefense` tower effectors, this hopefully turns the current plain race into an exciting fight for the flag.\\n\\nThe project will be mentored by _@Niruandaleth_ and _@Skaldarnar_.\\n\\n  <div align=\\"center\\">\\n    <img src=\\"./las-items.png\\"

first part will bring a more pacifist way of collecting wool to craft a nice warm vest: instead of having to kill sheep to get their wool, a new shearing mechanism will be added.\\nThe main focus for

have cut deep into the rock, mountains made of rock instead of sand, and more.\\nA \\"small proof of concept\\" in shadertoy looks already promising.\\nThe implementation in Terasology should look

create a modular framework for world generation in Destination: Sol.\\nThe main motivation behind this project is to allow more flexibility in the way the world can be generated.\\nInstead of the current system which has very few options for world generation, Isaiah\'s work will lay the foundation for a system which can support many options.\\n\\nThe new world-gen system will consist of a `WorldBuilder` class which will be able to initialize various types of `Generator` classes.\\nThese `Generator` classes will represent the various different entities that make up the Destination: Sol world: solar systems, planets, and mazes.\\n\\nThe generators will be implementations of abstract classes, such as `PlanetGenerator` for planets or `SolSystemGenerator` for solar systems.\\nIn addition, there will be specific implementations of these classes, like `DefaultSolSystemGenerator` or `DefaultPlanetGenerator`.\\n\\nThis will serve as the foundation for more interesting generators, allowing for behaviors like `DesertPlanetGenerator` or `WaterPlanetGenerator` etc.\\n\\n> With this project, I hope to add a lot of flair to the way world generation is done in Destination:

update post about all the neat stuff that has been going on in\\nthe world of Terasology! Half blog, half changelog, completely cool._\\n\\n## 🚀 Release Notes\\n\\nWe\'re happy to announce various releases of projects maintained by The Terasology Foundation over the past weeks.\\n\\nFirst of all, our user interface library [TeraNUI] was [released in version 3.0.0](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TeraNUI/releases/tag/v3.0.0), opening the way for new developments in the future.\\n_@pollend_ and _@DarkWeird_ work on experimental features for v4 related to dependency injection in [gestalt].\\n\\nTalking about [gestalt], the Java library collection providing core game engine capabilities the Terasology Engine is built on, was [released in version 7.1.0](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/gestalt/releases/tag/v7.1.0).\\nIn this release, _@keturn_ fixed some permission issues found in `ModuleEnvironment` and improved compatibility with semantic versioning when comparing snapshot versions.\\n\\nMost importantly, we are happy to announce, that we released [Terasology 5.0.0 / Alpha 20](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/releases/tag/v5.0.0) after successfully testing the second release candidate in our [July Playtest](#july-playtest).\\nPlease note, that starting with this version, the minimal system requirements have changed. The GPU now has to support at least OpenGL 3.3.\\nFurthermore, this release has a known rendering bug showing square artifacts in the corner / at the edges of the screen (see [GitHub issue #4542](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/issues/4542)).\\n\\n## 📰 Since last TeraSaturday ...\\n\\nMany thanks to our contributors since last [TeraSaturday #14]: _@ahv15_, _@Avalancs_, _@BenjaminAmos_, _@Casals_, _@Cervator_, _@DarkWeird_, _@Hume2_, _@IsaiahBlanks_, _@jdrueckert_, _@KdotJPG_, _@keturn_, _@meetcshah19, _@NicholasBatesNZ*, *@NicolaasJKotze*, *@pollend*, *@ryuk156*, *@skaldarnar*, *@tolziplohu*, and *@ZhouRicky\\\\_ 👏\\n\\nThe additional effort to mentor this year\'s Google Summer of Code (GSoC) projects definitely took its toll on our contributor\'s capacities to work on other topics.\\nHowever, we\'re happy that we still have a lot of things to show for over the past weeks.\\n\\nA big shout-out to _@Michael P_ (aka _@pollend_), who tirelessly worked on migrating rendering to OpenGL 3.3, improve performance, and buzzed around the codebase, fixing issues and cleaning up code left and right 🐝\\nAnother shout-out to _@keturn_, who relentlessly makes sure that we do not forget about investigating and fixing failing tests, and continuously challenges everybody to keep up the quality work 👍\\n\\nIn other news, we split the stages of our build pipeline to allow for a bit more detailed insights into test failures and quality-related analytics. Talking about tests, the [module tests are recovering](https://jenkins.terasology.io/teraorg/job/Terasology/job/Modules/view/Omega/){:target=\\"\\\\_blank\\"} from the past migration efforts.\\n\\n> We updated some tests to use Module Testing Environment, making some fixes to it along the way. We also removed some other \\"Environment\\" test classes (#4830) which were similarly named but not compatible.\\n>\\n> That makes one less thing to be confused over for module developers.\\n>\\n> <div align=\\"right\\">\\n> -- <i>@keturn</i>\\n> </div>\\n\\nThese and other minor efforts were coordinated in our weekly Org Meeting (every Saturday, 4PM UTC on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/terasology)) using our [Org Meeting Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/4cw7Q1BJ/org-meeting-board){:target=\\"\\\\_blank\\"}.

Below are some canapés:\\n\\n  <div class=\\"row\\">\\n   <div class=\\"col-md-4\\"> <img src=\\"../2021-07-24-teraspotlight-gsoc-2021-halftime-show-tell/las_pregame-phase-countdown.png\\"  /> </div>\\n   <div class=\\"col-md-4\\">  <img src=\\"../2021-07-24-teraspotlight-gsoc-2021-halftime-show-tell/js_sheep-shearing-before.png\\"  /></div>\\n   <div class=\\"col-md-4\\">  <img src=\\"../2021-07-24-teraspotlight-gsoc-2021-halftime-show-tell/mr_mesas.png\\"  /></div>\\n  </div>\\n\\nThe students will continue to contribute to different areas of our wide ecosystem, ranging from modernizing our web presence over world generation both, in space and on earth, to improvements in various gameplays.\\n\\n### 💻 Remote Mob Programming\\n\\nMob programming, similar to pair programming, is an approach to develop software with multiple people on the same computer. It leverages the different experiences and mindsets of multiple developers to find the best solution for a problem, taking into account various perspectives on it. Further, it is beneficial for team building and knowledge exchange as the collaborators learn how their colleagues approach a problem and technical expertise can be shared while doing so.\\n\\nBeing spread across two continents, _@keturn_, _@Michael P_ (aka _@pollend_), _@skaldarnar_ and I, _@Niruandaleth_ (aka _@jdrueckert_) had to fall back to remote options rather than sitting in the same room. However, with the help of our Discord voice channel and IntelliJ\'s collaboration tool [\\"Code With Me\\"](https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2020/09/28/code-with-me-eap/), we actually had a good and productive time investigating module permissions and test issues.\\n\\n### 🕹️ July Playtest\\n\\nAfter a long time of bigger migrations in the underlying foundations of Terasology and the required stabilization efforts in their aftermath, we finally got around to another playtest session. One by one, we started our playtest server with Metal Renegades, Light & Shadow, Josharias\' Survival, and Core Gameplay.\\n\\nApart from a few minor issues, the biggest problems that were identified are related to multiplayer bugs - gameplay aspects that work fine in singleplayer, but don\'t in multiplayer - and performance issues.\\nIn a later investigation, we found that the observed performance issues seem to be more of a problem with the server setup rather than Terasology itself.\\nHowever, this still needs investigation, but we hope to improve the playtest experience by leveraging a dockerized setup in the future.\\n\\n### 📸 Media\\n\\nWe are happy and honoured to be mentioned as one of the \\"Top 10 Games like Minecraft\\" comparison video on YouTube. Embedded below is the full video, to directly jump to the mention of Terasology, use the following shortlink: [https://youtu.be/0QO1nXkre94?t=476](https://youtu.be/0QO1nXkre94?t=476).\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0QO1nXkre94\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n\x3c!-- References --\x3e\\n\\n[teranui]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TeraNUI\\n[gestalt]: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/gestalt\\n[terasaturday #14]: https://terasology.org/ModuleSite/blog/2021-05-16-terasaturday-14\\n[teraspotlight: gsoc 2021 halftime show & tell]: https://terasology.org/ModuleSite/blog/2021-07-24-TeraSpotlight-GSOC-2021-Halftime-Show-Tell\\n"},{"path":"/blog/tera-saturday-11-gsoc-2021-is-coming","tags":["TeraSaturday"],"posttype":"blog","cover":{"publicURL":"/ModuleSite/static/242bd9dd0214993ce7ff3a03bbf157ac/cover.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/ModuleSite/static/242bd9dd0214993ce7ff3a03bbf157ac/a764f/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/242bd9dd0214993ce7ff3a03bbf157ac/fb67e/cover.jpg 480w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/242bd9dd0214993ce7ff3a03bbf157ac/3059d/cover.jpg 960w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/242bd9dd0214993ce7ff3a03bbf157ac/a764f/cover.jpg 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/242bd9dd0214993ce7ff3a03bbf157ac/3a3a2/cover.webp 480w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/242bd9dd0214993ce7ff3a03bbf157ac/bde8a/cover.webp 960w,\\n/ModuleSite/static/242bd9dd0214993ce7ff3a03bbf157ac/c512e/cover.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"}]},"width":1920,"height":1080}}},"title":"TeraSaturday #11: GSOC 2021 is Coming","author":"Niruandaleth & Skaldarnar","excerpt":"Welcome to the return of TeraSaturday, a not-so-weekly update post about all the neat stuff that has been going on in\\nthe world of…","date":"2021-03-13","description":"An exploration of recent events in Terasology development.","imageTag":null,"customLogo":null,"postNumber":null,"position":null,"mainImage":null,"content":"\\n_Welcome to the return of TeraSaturday, a not-so-weekly update post about all the neat stuff that has been going on in\\nthe world of Terasology!

This required a lot of groundwork around updating depencies ([#4558], [#4557], [#4564]) and tests ([#4563] and associated [module PRs migrating to JUnit 5][modules:junit5]). Alongside, we got back to subsystem extractions driven by _@DarkWeird_ and some fine tuning of **LOD Chunks** ([#4567]) by _@4Denthusiast_ and improvements to the **Discord integration** ([#4271]) by _@iHDeveloper_.\\n\\nIn total, we merged [41 engine PRs](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AMovingBlocks+type%3Apr+merged%3A2021-02-27..2021-03-13) and [36 PRs on modules](https://github.com/search?q=org%3ATerasology+type%3Apr+merged%3A2021-02-27..2021-03-13).\\n\\n## 🎀️ Community Highlights\\n\\nThis week\'s community highlight started off on November last year, when _@askneller_ opened a PR to add a \\"red flash\\" as visual indicator when the player receives damage ([Terasology/Health#53]).\\nWe eventually found the time to follow-up on that, and push it over the finish line ([Terasology/Health#67]).\\n\\nFrom now on, you\'ll see a visual indicator when being hit. The indicator will hint at where the damage is coming from, e.g., show a flashing read indicator on the left edge of the screen when being hit from the left.\\nIf no specific direction can be identified, e.g., if the damage is due to thirst or falling damage, all indicators will flash up at the same time.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n<img src=\\"./damage-flash.gif\\" alt=\\"Sorted in-game help\\"/>\\n</p>\\n\\n---\\n\\nLet\'s end this post with a \\"service announcement\\" which also fits the **T**oday **I** **L**earned category of things:\\n\\n> ℹ️ Public Service Announcement: Clean the log files from your ~/.gradle/daemon folder once in a while. I\'ve got over 800 MB in there right now.\\n>\\n> (That\'s the gradle user home directory: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/directory_layout.html#dir:gradle_user_home\\n> Windows might name
