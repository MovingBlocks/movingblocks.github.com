# Alchemy

This module adds several kinds of herbs and the ability to brew potions with a variety of effects. The herbs are either
procedurally generated by the herbalism system or pre-defined by the developers. The herbalism system manages how herbs
are grown and where they are generated onto the world. The brewable potions all originate from the Potions module.

The potion brewing process involves a HerbalismStation, and requires water, fuel, the prerequisite herbs for the
recipe, and a potion bottle. Please note that a more durable potion bottle will be able to be reused more times compared
to less durable one.
