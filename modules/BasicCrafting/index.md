A module which allows greatly extensible crafting flavours with a centralised recipe store.
Aimed at being simple and as easy as possible to add recipes.

# Features
Contains a simple to use List type flavour. This simply has a
list of inputs and a single output. If the player has all the
inputs in their inventory then the output can be crafted.

This method supports multiple ways of specifying an item to
allow for different items to be used as the same input.

To open up the crafting window press the `F` button
