# Edible Flora

This module adds a basic set of farming bushes and a simple progression to grow more advanced produce. It uses [Simple Farming](http://github.com/Terasology/SimpleFarming), [Hunger](http://github.com/Terasology/Hunger) and [Thirst](http://github.com/Terasology/Thirst).

# Player Guide

## Getting Started
Before you can grow anything you're going to need something to plant. Scattered around the world you will find some wild seed bushes. These drop a random produce when they're destroyed which you can then plant.
Once you've broken a few bushes you'll want to plant them by **right clicking** at the ground. The bush will grow and once it reaches it's final stage it you can harvest it using **E**  
If you want more advanced bushes that restore more then you can craft the seeds together. Press **N** to open up the crafting window. In here you can select a recipe and press the **Craft** button to attempt to craft the item. If successful, you can then plant the result as normal and reap ypur rewards.

If you break the bush in anything other than the last stage it will be destroyed without dropping anything, so be careful.

## Dealing with vines
Vines are planted exactly the same as bushes, but grow to be up to 20 blocks long. They grow randomly but will avoid walls, so you can use that to direct them. Along their length they will spawn 'buds' these are exactly the same as bushes and are how you can harvest items from the vine.  
Be careful, if you break a block on the vine, everything down of the root will also be destroyed, including the buds. (but it will all grow back)
