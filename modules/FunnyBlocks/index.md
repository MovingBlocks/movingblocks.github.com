## Playing
After installing and activating this module in a new world you have two options as to how to access the Funny Blocks:
1. Install and activate a world generator that includes some of these blocks (see [FunnyGenerator](https://github.com/NicholasBatesNZ/FunnyGenerators) as an example). The blocks will be spawned in the world automatically.
2. Press the ~ key and enter the command `give BlockName` where "BlockName" is the name of the desired block as taken from the list above. This block will appear in your inventory.
