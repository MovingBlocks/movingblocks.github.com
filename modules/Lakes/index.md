Lakes
=======================


Current features:  
-lakes based on distorted circles
-underground and surface lakes and lava lakes  
-underground will create a small cave above them, and surface lakes will smooth out their shorelines a little
-desert lakes have palm trees around them

Known issues:  
- Occasionally, lakes have uneven surfaces
- Underground lakes sometimes overlap with each other
- Lakes are far more common in generally flat areas

Future plans:  
-join adjacent surface lakes together to one waterheight  
-add lake biome  
-base lake probability  on surfacehumidityfacet
