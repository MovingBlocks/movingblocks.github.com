PhysicalStats
============

This module adds a basic RPG stats system consisting of seven different physical attributes or stats. Plus, a system for
modifying these stats is in place.

These attributes are the following:

* Strength (STR) - Affects physical damage dealt.
* Dexterity (DEX) - Affects weapon accuracy and item use speed (not implemented).
* Constitution (CON) - Affects entity's health. At base, 1 CON = 10 HP.
* Agility (AGI) - Affects entity movement speed.
* Endurance (END) - Affects carrying capacity and some interactions with status effects (not implemented).
* Charisma (CHA) - Affects NPC interactions and haggling (not implemented).
* Luck (LUK) - Affects the success/benefits/penalties of many different actions (not implemented).

This module is intended to be extended by other modules for more complex interactions.
