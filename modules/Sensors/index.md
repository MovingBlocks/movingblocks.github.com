# Sensors

This module is used to sense other entities by an entity.
There are various sensing methods available like area detection, weight detection, line of sight detection etc.

Checkout the module [CombatSystem](https://github.com/Terasology/CombatSystem) to see how they are implemented in traps in that module.
