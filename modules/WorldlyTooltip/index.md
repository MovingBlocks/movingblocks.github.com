# WorldlyTooltip

Shows what you are looking at.

This module works with [WorldlyTooltipAPI](https://github.com/Terasology/WorldlyTooltipAPI), that contains the events `GetTooltipIconEvent` and `GetTooltipNameEvent`.
The WorldlyTooltipAPI module needs to be added as a dependency by all modules that want to use the WorldlyTooltip feature.

Works with:

### Blocks
