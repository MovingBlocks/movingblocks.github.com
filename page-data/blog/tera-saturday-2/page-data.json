There are some quirks to work out with converting Blender's</li>\n</ul>\n<p>data structures to Terasology's block shape structure; since Blender stores all the UV and normal data per <em>face</em> instead\nof per <em>vertex,</em> it may need an update or two to the .shape format. But, if all goes as planned, all the old .shape files\nwill still work fine <em>(no need for another massive file conversion like when all the blocks in the Core module got moved\nto CoreBlocks!)</em> and new .shape files will be able to handle multiple UV locations per vertex. <em>(In words that less geeky,\nthat means we'll be able to have more advanced textures and lighting for blocks with complex shapes. Shiny shiny.)</em></p>\n<hr>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/270264625419911192/666236136057733150/unknown.png\" alt=\"Inferno!\" style=\"width:800px;padding:8px\">\n<ul>\n<li>Pardon me for being blunt... but if you download this module update, you can go to hell.
