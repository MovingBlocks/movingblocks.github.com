🎄️\nEnjoy the holidays and look out for announcements on our Discord channel - there could be a suprise event before the end of the year 😉️</p>","timeToRead":2,"excerpt":"Welcome to the return of TeraSaturday, a not-so-weekly update post about all the neat stuff that has been going on in\nthe world of…","frontmatter":{"title":"TeraSaturday #8: A Merry, Gooey Christmas!","ddate":"Dec 25th, 2020","tags":["TeraSaturday"],"author":"Niruandaleth","cover":{"publicURL":"/ModuleSite/static/15209f4e0afad9905bf8905e70276ef5/cover.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8b8b8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/ModuleSite/static/15209f4e0afad9905bf8905e70276ef5/a764f/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/15209f4e0afad9905bf8905e70276ef5/fb67e/cover.jpg 480w,\n/ModuleSite/static/15209f4e0afad9905bf8905e70276ef5/3059d/cover.jpg 960w,\n/ModuleSite/static/15209f4e0afad9905bf8905e70276ef5/a764f/cover.jpg 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/ModuleSite/static/15209f4e0afad9905bf8905e70276ef5/3a3a2/cover.webp 480w,\n/ModuleSite/static/15209f4e0afad9905bf8905e70276ef5/bde8a/cover.webp 960w,\n/ModuleSite/static/15209f4e0afad9905bf8905e70276ef5/c512e/cover.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"}]},"width":1920,"height":1080}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/tera-saturday-8-a-merry-gooey-christmas","date":"2020-12-25T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tera-saturday-8-a-merry-gooey-christmas"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1865044719"]}
