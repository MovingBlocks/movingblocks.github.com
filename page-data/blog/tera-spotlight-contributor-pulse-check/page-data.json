shout-out to <a href=\"https://www.mural.co/\">Mural</a>, an awesome tool allowing for very simple collaborative brainstorming for various purposes.\nWe're happy to have been accepted for their free nonprofit plan and had a very good time using Mural for our workshop.</p>\n<p>Every workshop needs some ground rules to allow for a productive session enabling everybody to participate and bring in their ideas and thoughts.\nA basic set of ground rules was given as a start, encouraging everybody to speak up to ask questions or request a break as well as to avoid finger-pointing and technical discussions.\nBased on this, the first part of our workshop concentrated on developing code of conduct for the workshop that we all feel comfortable with and agree on, by asking ourselves, what we expect to make this a \"meaningful &#x26; pleasant workshop\"</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto;

workshop to be fun, but still talk very honestly and openly about what we value and want for Terasology.\nReflecting how we interact with each other in our community, another big focus point was fairness.\nIt showed that everybody's opinion is important to us and we want to give everybody an equal chance to bring in their ideas.\nOn a similar note, it showed that we value honesty and openness while practicing mutual respect in terms of communication and focus.</p>\n<p>With this code of conduct in place, it was time to talk agenda.\nThe workshop was prepared to allow covering three modules: motivation, vision and community.\nWith the content-wise thoughts on what would make this a \"meaningful workshop\", it already became clear that our main area of interest was finding out what our individual goals and visions for Terasology are and see which overlap and which diverge.\nThe planned workshop time allowed us to cover two of the three prepared modules and with \"vision\" being set, we decided to in addition talk about \"motivation\".</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto;

both modules followed a very similar structure.\nFor each module, we started with a fun little \"spirit animal\" icebreaker exercise asking everybody to post a picture of an animal describing how they view or feel about something üêæ\nAfterwards, we had five different prompts to self-reflect on, aimed at being very honest to ourselves and explore our personal opinions and thoughts.\nFor each of these prompts, everyone first got some \"alone-time\" to self-reflect and answer before we made all notes visible to everybody else.\nThe second step for each of these prompts was then to read through everything, clarify anything that was unclear and try to cluster everything.\nThe clustering allowed us to identify areas of overlap, showing what's important to us collectively, but also areas of divergence, showing individual motivations and visions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"-motivation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#-motivation\" aria-label=\" motivation permalink\" class=\"anchor

individual human being with different character, mindset, goals and dreams.\nWe act and contribute in different ways and for different reasons.\nThis is why, the first question we asked ourselves was: \"Which animal do I feel like when contributing to Terasology?\"</p>\n<p>From ant to elephant, from whale to platypus, from peacock to ant-eater - the spirit animals representing us contributing to Terasology were as different as we are as people.\nWhile some of us run around all busy, working on a lot of different topics and areas, others prefer to contribute with large changes with long term goals.\nSome even do both, being rather casual for a while and then bursting out in activity.\nAt the same time, some of us like to produce fancy, visible features and show them off, while others concentrate on \"eating\" bugs or work behind the scenes to keep the community going.</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display:

both, an existing user base and that we ourselves use what we work on</li>\n<li><strong>Community</strong> - a welcoming, open, active and knowledgeable community is as important to us as good organization and a low entry-barrier</li>\n<li><strong>Potential</strong> - it's important to us that we see the potential for growth and adoption by users</li>\n<li><strong>Match to Interests</strong> - we actually like it when topics, tools and technology we deal with at work and in our free time blend well and we can use the resulting synergies to improve and become more experienced</li>\n<li><strong>Nerdiness</strong> - we're drawn to interesting yet quality-improving tools and languages and technical challenges that give us the opportunity to grow</li>\n</ul>\n<h3

brings up the question of whether that's also reflected in why we joined Terasology.\nSo it was time to revisit what motivated us to join Terasology and the paths that led us here in the first place.\nFurther, we reflected on our relationship to Terasology - what Terasology as a project currently is to us and what keeps us bound to it.</p>\n<p>The responses to the \"I joined Terasology to ...\" varied quite a bit, but still we were able to find a few patterns in our clustering activity.\nWhile most of us participated in GSoC and stumbled upon Terasology in the process of looking for a suitable project to contribute to, others learned about it in different ways or, in the case of Cervator our project lead, were around from the very start.\nThe clusters of the previous reflection also showed up again here - many of us joined for any or multiple of the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to help realize the project's potential of becoming a game we ourselves (would like to) play üïπÔ∏è</li>\n<li>to enable others to build on it, create an alternative to Minecraft or just \"have a frame to paint in\" üé®</li>\n<li>to learn and improve our skills üéì</li>\n<li>to meet people with similar interest üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª</li>\n<li>to work on something we're interested in ü§ì</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of these are nostalgic memories on the positive intentions and expectations that led us to join Terasology.\nSo next it was time to be honest to ourselves and enter the present time and with it our current feelings towards our project.\nThe thoughts triggered by the \"Terasology currently is to me ...\" prompt showed a lot of love and heartfelt bond with Terasology, but also brought up a first taste of what we're unhappy with and what concerns us:</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n    \"Terasology is a <b>tech playground</b>\"\n</div>\n<p>Terasology is a place to learn and grow.\nIt offers a lot of different areas to \"self-actualize\", to experiment, improve and grow as a coder, as a software developer, as a person.\nIt also impressively highlights the intricacies of Java and Gradle and poses interesting programming problems and space for architectural discussions and design.</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n\"Terasology is a <b>tech demo</b>\"\n</div>\n<p>All these different areas for self-actualization and experimenting and our ambition to make everybody happy took their toll on Terasology's \"state\".\nWe are struggling and are in search of both an identity and a player base.\nFrankly put, our codebase is quite broken and more a proof of concept than an actual game.</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n\"Terasology is <b>our drive & ambition</b>\"\n</div>\n<p>In the midst of all these challenges, the important thing is that we're still willing to continue working on it.\nWe are aware of the state of our codebase, but we still see the potential, we see what it could become one day.\nSo we continue to put in the work, fix bugs, improve architecture, documentation and code and try to motivate more people to join the effort.</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n\"Terasology is <b>our brand</b>\"\n</div>\n<p>Why do we even bother, you ask? Because we love Terasology.\nEspecially in the current \"scary world of 2020/2021\", Terasology for us is an anchor of stability, a refuge to code in and a hiding place from all the real-world mess.\nFor us, it's our main non-work activity and a regular part of our weekly focus time off the clock.\nWe consider ourselves a community of friends and deeply care for our project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"-yays--neys-\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#-yays--neys-\" aria-label=\" yays  neys  permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>üî• \"Yay\"s &#x26;
