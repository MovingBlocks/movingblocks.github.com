            The Terasology project was born from a Minecraft-inspired tech demo
            in 2011. Over the years it has been a playground for different kinds
            of technical experiments and proof of concepts. The community
            strives to make Terasology a stable platform for various types of
            gameplay settings in a voxel world. The contributors are a diverse
            mix of software developers, designers, game testers, graphic
            artists, and musicians.

                The project was founded in 2011 by {`Benjamin "Begla" Glatzel`}
                while researching procedural terrain generation and effective
                rendering techniques. He succeeded in creating a minecraft-like
                demo engine, the foundation stone for what Terasology is today.

                From the ground up, Terasology was built to be very modular and
                support different kinds of gameplay ideas. We still host a large
                number of modules under the {`"Terasology" `}GitHub organization
                providing basic and advanced gameplay content as well as world
                generation options and technical libraries.
              </p>
              <p>
                Combining these modules allows to create very different kinds of
                gameplay in our voxel worlds. The possibilities are manifold and
                range from crafting- or trading-oriented survival over
                capture-the-flag to puzzle-style experiences and tower defenses.
              </p>
              <p>
                We especially appreciate expertise or interest in UI/UX, world
                generation or well-thought out gameplay mechanics, but also
                always have an open ear for crazy ideas for existing or new
                modules and gameplay content.
